## Decision Log

| Decision | Date | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Weight loss niche first | Jan 2026 | Emotional urgency, measurable, $405B market |
| France first | Jan 2026 | No AI phone call competitor, voice-preferred culture |
| €9.90 entry price | Feb 2026 | Below Noom (€17), above free apps, impulse-buy threshold |
| Presto Fresco pizza perks | Feb 2026 | 92% cost savings vs cash for nano influencers |
| VAPI.ai for voice | TBD | Best price/quality for AI phone calls |
| Supabase for backend | TBD | Free tier, Postgres, auth, realtime |
| Brevo for email | TBD | French company, GDPR native, free tier |

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Users don't answer calls | Critical | Medium | Branded caller ID, preview notifications, streak FOMO |
| VAPI.ai pricing too high at scale | High | Medium | Negotiate volume pricing, explore alternatives |
| French users won't pay for apps | High | Medium | 7-day trial, €9.90 impulse price, value framing vs coach |
| Noom enters France aggressively | Medium | Low | Speed advantage, voice differentiator, local partnerships |
| RGPD compliance issues | Critical | Low | OVHcloud hosting, DPO review, privacy-by-design |
| Team of 2 → burnout | High | High | Prioritize ruthlessly, hire community manager Month 3 |
