# Product Hunt Launch Plan — Call Me Maybe

> Complete playbook for launching CMM on Product Hunt: pre-launch preparation, launch day execution, and post-launch conversion strategy.

---

## 1. Pre-Launch (2-4 Weeks Before)

### Ship Page Setup

Create a "Coming Soon" page on Product Hunt as early as possible. This builds an email list and social proof before launch day.

**Tagline for Ship Page:**
> Your AI accountability coach that actually calls you every day.

**Ship Page Description:**
> Call Me Maybe is an AI-powered phone coach that calls you daily to check in on your goals. Built for people who've tried every app and notification but keep falling off. Because you can ignore a push notification — but you always answer a phone call.

**What to Include on the Ship Page:**
- One hero image (phone ringing with CMM branding)
- A 30-second demo video or GIF showing a call in action
- 3 bullet points: Daily phone calls, AI-powered accountability, works with any goal
- Email capture: "Get notified when we launch + early access pricing"
- Maker's avatar and one-liner: "Built by Aaron because he kept ghosting his fitness apps"

**Ship Page Timeline:**
- Set up 3-4 weeks before launch
- Share the Ship page link in your network, social media, and Facebook groups
- Target: 200+ subscribers before launch day

### Hunter Recruitment

A good hunter (someone who "hunts" your product on PH) amplifies your launch significantly. Their followers get notified.

**Who to Approach:**
1. **Indie hackers who've launched health/wellness products** — they understand the space and have relevant followers
2. **Prolific PH hunters** (check the PH leaderboard) — Chris Messina, Kevin William David, Ben Tossell
3. **French tech community hunters** — people active in La French Tech who hunt regularly
4. **AI/productivity hunters** — CMM sits at the intersection of AI + productivity + health

**DM Template for Hunter Recruitment:**
> Hey [Name]! I've been following your Product Hunt activity and loved your hunt of [specific product]. I'm launching Call Me Maybe — an AI accountability coach that literally calls users on the phone every day to keep them on track with their goals. We're starting with weight loss (huge pain point, zero good solutions for daily accountability). Would you be interested in hunting it? Happy to give you a full demo and early access. Launch date is [date].

**Timing:** Reach out 2-3 weeks before launch. Have a backup hunter in case your first choice declines.

**If You Can't Get a Hunter:** Self-hunting works fine. Many successful launches are self-hunted. Don't let hunter recruitment delay your launch.

### Community Building (2-4 Weeks Before)

**Daily PH Engagement:**
- Comment on 3-5 launches per day (genuine, thoughtful comments — not "great product!")
- Upvote products you genuinely find interesting
- Follow makers in the health, AI, and productivity categories
- Join PH community discussions

**Comment Template for Other Launches:**
> This is a smart approach to [problem]. I'm curious about [specific feature] — how does that work under the hood? I'm building in a similar space (AI accountability coaching) and I've found that [relevant insight]. Congrats on shipping!

**Why This Matters:** PH's algorithm favors makers who are active community members. Your comments also put your profile (and upcoming product) in front of potential upvoters.

### Teaser Content Strategy

**Week -4 (4 weeks before):**
- Twitter/X post: "Building an AI that calls you on the phone every morning. Not a notification. Not a text. An actual phone call. Because you can't swipe away a ringing phone."
- Share on indie hacker communities (IndieHackers.com, r/SideProject, Hacker News Show)

**Week -3:**
- Behind-the-scenes tweet thread: "Here's what happened when I replaced my alarm with an AI accountability call for 30 days" (real data from your own usage)
- Instagram story / LinkedIn post with a 15-second clip of a CMM call

**Week -2:**
- "We're launching on Product Hunt in 2 weeks" announcement
- Share the Ship page link everywhere
- Ask friends and network to subscribe to the Ship page

**Week -1:**
- Final teaser: "One week until launch. Here's the one metric that convinced me this works: [X]% daily engagement rate. People don't skip phone calls."
- DM your top 50 contacts with the launch date and ask them to support you

### Email List Preparation

**Pre-Launch Email Sequence:**

**Email 1 (at signup):**
Subject: You're on the list. Here's what's coming.
> Thanks for joining the Call Me Maybe waitlist. We're launching on Product Hunt on [date]. Here's what CMM does: it calls you. Every day. On the phone. An AI coach that checks in on your goals and won't let you ghost your commitments. We'll email you the morning of launch with the direct link. Your upvote and comment would mean the world.

**Email 2 (3 days before launch):**
Subject: 3 days until launch — here's how you can help
> Call Me Maybe launches on Product Hunt this [day]. Here's exactly how you can support us:
> 1. Go to [link] on launch day
> 2. Upvote if you think daily phone accountability is a good idea
> 3. Leave a comment (even a question — PH loves engagement)
> That's it. Takes 2 minutes. Means everything to us.

**Email 3 (launch morning):**
Subject: WE'RE LIVE on Product Hunt — please vote now
> [Direct link to PH page]
> We just launched. Every upvote in the first 4 hours matters enormously for ranking. Please click the link, upvote, and if you have a minute, leave a comment. Thank you endlessly.

## 2. Launch Day Assets

### Tagline (under 60 characters)

| # | Tagline | Chars | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|-------|
| 1 | **Your AI coach that calls you daily to keep you on track** | 56 | Clear, benefit-driven, explains the mechanic |
| 2 | An AI accountability coach that actually calls your phone | 57 | Emphasizes "actually" — differentiator |
| 3 | Daily AI phone calls to keep you accountable to your goals | 58 | Goal-oriented framing |
| 4 | The accountability coach that calls you every morning | 52 | Simple, human-sounding |
| 5 | Stop ghosting your goals. Get a daily AI accountability call | 59 | Problem-first, punchy |

**Recommendation: #1 — "Your AI coach that calls you daily to keep you on track"**

It's clear, it explains what the product does, and it hits the key differentiator (phone calls, not notifications) in natural language. It works for people scrolling the PH feed who give you 2 seconds of attention.

### Description (under 260 characters)

> Call Me Maybe is an AI-powered phone coach that calls you every day to check in on your goals. Start with weight loss, fitness, or any habit. No app to open, no notification to ignore — just a daily phone call that keeps you accountable. Free to start.

(253 characters)

### First Comment — The Maker's Comment

This is the single most important piece of copy on your launch. It appears at the top of the comments section and sets the tone for the entire discussion.

---

**Hey Product Hunt!**

I'm Aaron, and I built Call Me Maybe because I have a shelf full of fitness apps I've downloaded, used for 3 days, and never opened again.

Sound familiar?

Here's the insight that changed everything for me: **I ignore notifications, but I always answer a phone call.** That's it. That's the whole thesis.

Call Me Maybe is an AI accountability coach that calls you on the phone every day. Not a push notification. Not a text. An actual phone call where an AI voice asks you:

- What's your plan for today?
- How did yesterday go?
- What got in your way?

It tracks your consistency over time, adapts to your goals, and — most importantly — it shows up every single day whether you feel motivated or not.

**Why phone calls?** Because there's something psychologically different about a ringing phone. You can't swipe it away. You can't "mark as read" and forget about it. You either answer and face your commitments, or you actively choose to ignore them. That friction is the feature.

**Why weight loss first?** Because it's the domain where the gap between knowing what to do and actually doing it is widest. Everyone knows they should eat better and move more. Almost nobody does it consistently. The missing piece isn't information — it's accountability.

**What's next:**
- Expanding to fitness, meditation, learning, and productivity goals
- Adding progress reports and trend analysis
- Building social accountability features (group challenges)
- Integration with health apps and wearables

**We're offering early PH members a special lifetime deal** — details on our site.

I'd love to hear:
1. Would you answer a daily AI phone call?
2. What goal would you use it for?
3. What would make you quit after a week?

Your honest feedback shapes what we build next. Don't hold back.

— Aaron

### Gallery — Screenshots and Images Needed

Prepare 5-6 high-quality images for the PH gallery. PH displays these as a carousel and they're critical for conversions.

| # | Image | Description | Purpose |
|---|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Hero Image** | Phone screen showing incoming call from "Call Me Maybe - Your Coach" with the CMM logo. Clean, aspirational. | First impression — immediately communicates "this is a phone call product" |
| 2 | **How It Works** | 3-step infographic: (1) Set your goal (2) Get a daily call (3) Stay accountable. Clean design, CMM brand colors. | Explains the product in 3 seconds |
| 3 | **Call Transcript** | Screenshot of a sample call transcript showing the AI asking questions and the user responding. Shows the conversational, non-judgmental tone. | Demonstrates the product experience |
| 4 | **Dashboard / Progress** | Screenshot of the user dashboard showing a consistency streak, weekly progress, and trends. | Shows the tracking/data angle for analytically-minded users |
| 5 | **Testimonial Card** | A designed testimonial card with a beta tester quote, their first name, and their result ("21-day streak — my longest ever"). | Social proof |
| 6 | **Pricing** | Clean pricing graphic showing Free tier vs. Pro tier. Emphasize "Free to start, upgrade when you're hooked." | Reduces friction — people know it's free before they click through |

**Image Specs:**
- Recommended: 1270 x 760 px (PH optimal)
- Format: PNG or high-quality JPEG
- Style: Match CMM brand — clean, modern, trustworthy
- First image is the most important (it's the thumbnail in the PH feed)

### Topics / Categories

Tag your launch with these PH topics for maximum discoverability:

**Primary:**
- Artificial Intelligence
- Health & Fitness
- Productivity

**Secondary:**
- Self Care
- Tech
- Task Management

**Why these work:** AI is the hottest category on PH (high traffic). Health & Fitness targets your core audience. Productivity broadens your appeal beyond weight loss.

### Pricing Display

Show a clean Free vs. Pro comparison:

**Free Tier:**
- 1 daily check-in call
- Basic goal tracking
- 7-day history

**Pro Tier (price TBD — display as "Early Bird Pricing"):**
- Unlimited daily calls
- Multiple goals
- Full history and analytics
- Progress reports
- Priority support

**Display Strategy:**
- Lead with "Free to start" — reduces friction to zero
- Show Pro pricing as "Launch Special" to create urgency
- If offering a PH-exclusive deal, display it prominently: "Product Hunt members: 50% off Pro for life"

### Who to DM for Support

Build this list BEFORE launch day. Have the messages pre-written.

**Tier 1 — Inner Circle (10-15 people):**
- Co-founder (Ata)
- Close friends who will definitely upvote and comment
- Family members with PH accounts (help them create one if needed)
- DM each personally with a unique message

**Tier 2 — Extended Network (30-50 people):**
- Twitter/X mutuals
- LinkedIn connections in tech/health
- Indie hacker community members you've engaged with
- Facebook group members who've DMed you about CMM
- Send a personalized but templated message

**Tier 3 — Communities (100+ people):**
- IndieHackers community
- Relevant Slack/Discord communities
- WhatsApp groups
- Reddit (where rules allow)
- Post public messages with the link

### Critical Launch Day Rules

1. **Reply to every single comment on PH.** Every. Single. One. This is non-negotiable. PH rewards engagement.
2. **Never ask for upvotes directly on PH.** Against the rules. Say "would love your support" or "check it out."
3. **Don't buy votes or use upvote services.** PH detects and penalizes this. Your launch will be killed.
4. **Stay positive in comments.** Even if someone is critical, respond with gratitude and curiosity.
5. **Don't obsess over the ranking.** Focus on genuine engagement. A #5 launch with 200 real comments beats a #1 launch with 50 generic ones.

---

## 4. Post-Launch

### Leverage the PH Badge

**On Your Website:**
- Add the PH badge to your landing page header: "Featured on Product Hunt" or "#X Product of the Day"
- Link the badge to your PH page (it continues to collect upvotes for months)
- Add it to your email signature for 2-3 months after launch

**On Social Media:**
- Update Twitter/X bio: "Building @CallMeMaybe — Featured on Product Hunt"
- LinkedIn headline update
- Use the badge in all future pitch decks and investor materials

**In Marketing Materials:**
- Include in email footer
- Add to App Store / Google Play description
- Reference in press pitches: "As featured on Product Hunt..."

### Blog Post: "How We Launched on Product Hunt"

Publish this 3-5 days after launch. It serves multiple purposes: content marketing, SEO, community goodwill, and a resource for other founders.

**Outline:**
1. Why we chose Product Hunt (and almost didn't)
2. What we did to prepare (2-week timeline)
3. Our launch day hour-by-hour
4. What worked (specific tactics and results)
5. What we'd do differently
6. Final results: upvotes, comments, signups, traffic
7. Advice for first-time launchers

**Where to Publish:**
- Your own blog (SEO)
- IndieHackers (community engagement + backlink)
- Medium (broader reach)
- LinkedIn article (professional network)
- Dev.to if there's a technical angle

### Follow Up with Voters

**Within 48 Hours of Launch:**
- Export your PH upvoter list (if available through PH's maker tools)
- Send a thank-you message to everyone who commented
- For people who asked questions in comments, follow up with longer answers via DM

**Week After Launch:**
- Email everyone who signed up during the PH launch:
  Subject: "Thanks for believing in Call Me Maybe"
  > You signed up during our Product Hunt launch and we wanted to say a genuine thank you. Here's what's happened since: [X upvotes, Y signups, Z calls made]. Here's what we're building next: [roadmap items]. Your feedback matters — reply to this email anytime.

### Convert PH Traffic to Signups

PH traffic spikes hard on launch day and drops fast. You need to capture as much as possible.

**Landing Page Optimization for PH Traffic:**
- Add a banner: "Welcome, Product Hunt! Get [X]% off Pro — PH exclusive"
- Simplify signup to one click (email only, no credit card)
- Show social proof: "Join [X] people getting daily accountability calls"
- Add a "How It Works" video above the fold
- Make the CTA unmissable: "Get Your First Free Call Now"

**PH-Specific Landing Page (Optional but Recommended):**
- Create a `/producthunt` or `/ph` landing page
- Personalize the message: "Hey, Product Hunt! Thanks for checking us out."
- Include PH-exclusive pricing
- Track traffic separately in your analytics

**Retargeting:**
- Set up Facebook/Instagram retargeting pixels before launch day
- Retarget PH visitors who didn't sign up with ads for 2 weeks after launch
- Use messaging like: "You saw us on Product Hunt. Ready to answer the call?"

## 5. Metrics to Track

### Upvote Targets

| Tier | Upvotes | What It Means |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Minimum Viable | 100-200 | You launched. You have a PH page and badge. Decent for a first launch. |
| Solid Launch | 200-400 | Top 10 of the day. Good traffic, good social proof. |
| Strong Launch | 400-700 | Top 5 of the day. Significant traffic spike. Press interest possible. |
| Exceptional | 700+ | #1-3 Product of the Day. Major traffic. Newsletter features likely. |

**Realistic target for a first launch with a moderate network: 150-300 upvotes.**

This gets you a PH badge, a solid traffic day, and credibility for future fundraising/press.

### Comments Target

| Tier | Comments | What It Means |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Low | 10-30 | Minimal engagement. Either the product didn't resonate or you didn't reply enough. |
| Good | 30-60 | Healthy discussion. Shows genuine interest. |
| Great | 60-100 | Very active launch. Strong community response. |
| Exceptional | 100+ | Viral-level engagement. Featured in PH newsletter guaranteed. |

**Realistic target: 30-50 comments.** You can influence this directly by replying to every comment (each reply counts) and asking questions in your replies that invite follow-up.

### Website Traffic from PH

| Metric | Target | How to Track |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| PH referral visits (launch day) | 1,000-3,000 | Google Analytics, UTM parameters |
| PH referral visits (launch week) | 2,000-5,000 | GA referral traffic |
| Bounce rate from PH | Under 60% | GA |
| Time on site from PH visitors | Over 1 min | GA |
| Pages per session from PH | Over 2 | GA |

### Signup Conversions

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| PH visitor to signup rate | 5-10% | Industry standard for PH launches |
| Signups on launch day | 50-150 | Based on 1,000-3,000 visits at 5-10% |
| Signups in launch week | 100-300 | Traffic tails off quickly |
| Free to paid conversion (30 days) | 3-5% | Typical for freemium products |
| Paid conversions from PH | 5-15 | Realistic first-launch expectation |

### Long-Tail Metrics (30-90 Days Post-Launch)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| PH page ongoing upvotes | +50-100 | PH pages continue collecting votes for months |
| Backlinks from PH launch | 3-10 | Other sites linking to your PH page = SEO value |
| Newsletter features | 1-3 | PH Daily, PH Weekly, and category newsletters |
| Press mentions citing PH | 1-2 | Journalists use PH as a source for trend stories |
| Investor inbound from PH | 0-3 | VCs browse PH. Don't expect it but be ready. |

## 7. Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Launching on a Monday.** Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays have the highest traffic on PH. Avoid Fridays (low engagement) and weekends (dead).

2. **Not having the first comment ready.** If you take 10 minutes to write your first comment after launch, early visitors see a bare page and leave.

3. **Asking for upvotes on PH.** This violates PH rules and can get your launch flagged. Say "support" or "check it out" instead.

4. **Ignoring comments.** An unanswered comment is a lost potential user. Reply to everything, even "cool product" comments (say "thanks! what goal would you use it for?").

5. **Spending all day on upvote count.** Upvotes matter, but comments and genuine engagement matter more for long-term value.

6. **Not having a conversion path.** PH traffic without a landing page optimized for signups is wasted traffic. Don't just send people to a homepage — send them to a signup flow.

7. **Forgetting time zones.** PH runs on PST. If you're in France, your launch goes live at 9 AM your time. Plan accordingly.

8. **Launching too early.** If your product doesn't work yet, wait. A bad PH launch is worse than no PH launch — you only get one good shot at a first impression.

9. **Not following up.** The real value of PH isn't launch day — it's the 30 days after. Follow up with every signup, every voter, every commenter.

10. **Going alone.** Recruit Ata (and any other team members, friends, or advisors) to help monitor comments and share the launch. More hands on deck = faster response times = better engagement.

---

## 8. Recommended Launch Day: Tuesday or Wednesday

**Best days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
**Best time:** 00:01 PST (9:01 AM France time)
**Avoid:** Monday (competition from weekend backlog), Friday-Sunday (low traffic)

**Recommended specific timing:**
- Launch on a Tuesday when there are no major tech events or Apple/Google announcements that would dominate the news cycle
- Check the PH upcoming page to see what else is launching that day — avoid days with well-funded, well-known products launching
