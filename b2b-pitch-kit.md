## 1. Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"Call Me Maybe is an AI coach that calls your employees every morning to help them lose weight and build healthy habits. Instead of an app they'll stop opening after 3 days, we proactively call them — and 87% answer every single day. It costs 10x less than a human coach, it's RGPD-compliant, and early data shows 2.7x better outcomes than self-monitoring apps. We're looking for a pilot partner in France."

## 2. One-Page Pitch for Mutuelles

### The Problem You're Paying For

Obesity costs the French healthcare system **€12.4 billion annually**. Your members with obesity-related conditions cost **2.5x more** in healthcare claims than healthy-weight members.

Current solutions don't work:
- Diet apps: 95% abandon rate within 30 days
- Nutrition counseling: expensive (€50-80/session), limited to monthly visits
- Wellness programs: low engagement (typically 15-20% participation)

### The Solution: Daily AI Accountability

Call Me Maybe is a voice-based AI coach that calls your members every morning for a 3-minute check-in. No app to download, no motivation needed — the phone rings, they answer.

**How it works:**
1. Member enrolls via your platform
2. Chooses preferred call time and goals
3. AI coach calls daily — reviews food, movement, mood
4. Streak system drives 87% daily engagement
5. Weekly reports track progress

### Why It Works

| Metric | Industry Average | Call Me Maybe |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Daily engagement | 15-20% | 87% |
| 30-day retention | 20% | 72% |
| Average streak | 4 days | 14 days |
| User satisfaction | 3.5/5 | 4.6/5 |

### ROI for Your Mutuelle

**Conservative scenario: 1,000 enrolled members**

| Category | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Members who lose 5%+ body weight (6 months) | ~150 (15%) |
| Avg healthcare cost reduction per member | €800-1,200/year |
| Total annual savings | €120,000 - €180,000 |
| Cost of CMM (€3/member/month wholesale) | €36,000/year |
| **Net ROI** | **€84,000 - €144,000/year** |
| **ROI multiple** | **3.3x - 5x** |

### Pilot Proposal

- **Duration**: 6 months
- **Size**: 200-500 members (voluntary enrollment)
- **Cost**: €2.50/member/month (pilot pricing, no setup fee)
- **Deliverables**: Monthly engagement reports, weight change data, satisfaction scores
- **Success criteria**: >50% daily engagement, >10% achieving 5% weight loss
- **RGPD**: Full compliance, data hosted in France (OVHcloud), no data sharing

### Why Now

- Mental health is "Grande Cause Nationale" 2025-2026 — holistic wellness is a national priority
- WW France bankruptcy (2025) — millions of members looking for alternatives
- AXA has €13.9M prevention fund (2025-2027) — innovation funding is available
- 76% of French consumers prefer voice channels — our medium fits the market

## 3. Corporate Wellness Pitch

### Subject: "Reduce absenteeism and healthcare costs with daily AI coaching"

### For HR Directors / QVT Managers

**The challenge:** Your employees want to be healthier, but they don't follow through on wellness programs.

- 70% of employees say they want to lose weight
- Only 12% actually use the wellness app you provide
- Gym memberships go unused after February

**Why current approaches fail:** They require employee initiative. They need to open an app, go to a gym, book a session. Life gets in the way.

**Call Me Maybe is different:** We call your employees. Every morning. 3 minutes. Done.

### Package Options

| Plan | Price | Includes |
|------|-------|----------|
| Starter (50-200 employees) | €5/employee/month | Daily AI calls, basic reporting |
| Professional (200-1000) | €3.50/employee/month | + Manager dashboard, group challenges |
| Enterprise (1000+) | Custom | + White-label, API integration, dedicated support |

All plans include: RGPD compliance, French data hosting, monthly engagement reports.

### QVT Benefits

| Metric | Industry Data |
|--------|--------------|
| Productivity gain from employee wellness | +20% |
| Reduction in turnover | -50% |
| Reduction in absenteeism | -25% |
| ROI on wellness programs | 3:1 to 6:1 |

### Pilot Process

1. **Week 1**: Onboard HR team, customize program for your goals
2. **Week 2-3**: Invite employees (voluntary, anonymous option available)
3. **Month 1-3**: Daily calls, monthly reports to HR
4. **Month 3 review**: Present results, decide on scale-up

### Perfect For

- Tech startups (50-500 employees, modern culture)
- Large groups with QVT budgets (CAC 40)
- Companies with high-stress environments (consulting, finance, tech)
- Organizations with obesity prevention mandates

## 4. Gym Chain Partnership Pitch

### For: Basic-Fit, Fitness Park, Keepcool, L'Appart Fitness

**Proposition:** Add CMM as a digital coaching layer to your membership.

### The Gap in Your Offering

Your members come to the gym 2-3 times per week. But what happens the other 4-5 days?

- No nutrition guidance outside the gym
- No daily accountability
- No habit tracking between sessions
- Result: 50% of members churn within 6 months

### CMM Fills the Gap

Daily AI phone calls keep your members engaged **between gym sessions**:
- Morning check-in: "Did you eat breakfast? Are you going to the gym today?"
- Nutrition coaching: photo food logging, portion guidance
- Streak system: "You've been to the gym 3x this week — amazing!"
- Recovery days: "Rest day? Perfect. Let's focus on hydration and sleep."

### Partnership Models

| Model | Revenue Share | Integration |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Referral | CMM pays €2/signup | QR codes in gym, trainer recommendations |
| Bundled | Gym adds €3-5/month to premium tier | CMM integrated in member portal |
| Co-branded | 50/50 revenue share | White-labeled "FitCoach by [Gym] powered by CMM" |
| Add-on | Gym sells CMM as €7.90/month add-on | Displayed at reception, in app |

### Why This Works for You

- **Reduce churn**: Members with daily engagement are 3x less likely to cancel
- **New revenue**: €3-7/member/month with zero operational overhead
- **Differentiation**: No other gym chain offers daily AI phone coaching
- **Data**: Understand your members' nutrition and habits (aggregated, anonymous)

### Quick Math: Basic-Fit (300 clubs, 4M members)

| Scenario | Adoption | Revenue |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Conservative (2%) | 80,000 members | €240,000/month |
| Moderate (5%) | 200,000 members | €600,000/month |
| Optimistic (10%) | 400,000 members | €1.2M/month |

Even at 2% adoption, this is significant recurring revenue with zero cost to the gym.

## 5. Dietitian Referral Partnership

### For: Madietenligne (2,900+ dietitians), individual practitioners

**Proposition:** Refer your patients to CMM for daily accountability between sessions.

### The Problem

You see patients once a month (or once every 2 weeks at best). Between visits, they're on their own. By the next appointment, they've often regressed.

### The Solution

CMM calls your patients every morning. We reinforce YOUR guidance daily:
- "Your dietitian recommended focusing on vegetables this week — how did dinner go?"
- "Remember to drink 1.5L of water today"
- "You mentioned to your dietitian that mornings are hardest — let's plan breakfast"

### What You Get

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Commission | 25% recurring (€2.50/month per referred patient) |
| Better outcomes | Patients come to appointments with 14+ days of daily data |
| Patient retention | Patients who use CMM stay with their dietitian 2x longer |
| Professional page | Your profile on callmemaybe.app/partners with backlink |
| Free access | Use CMM yourself for free (understand the experience) |

### How It Works

1. You get a unique referral link: `callmemaybe.app/ref/dr-[NAME]`
2. Recommend CMM to patients who need daily accountability
3. Patient signs up → gets 7-day free trial
4. Patient subscribes → you earn 25% commission monthly
5. Monthly report: see how many patients signed up, total commission

### Commission Calculator

| Referred Patients | Monthly Commission | Annual Commission |
|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 5 | €12.50 | €150 |
| 10 | €25 | €300 |
| 25 | €62.50 | €750 |
| 50 | €125 | €1,500 |
| 100 | €250 | €3,000 |

### To Mutuelles

**Subject:** Reduce obesity healthcare costs by 20% with daily AI coaching

**Body:**

Bonjour [NAME],

I'm Aaron, co-founder of Call Me Maybe — an AI voice coach that calls members daily for weight loss accountability.

Unlike apps that go unopened, we proactively call users every morning. Our pilot data shows 87% daily engagement and 2.7x better outcomes than self-monitoring.

We're looking for a pilot partner among French mutuelles. 200 members, 6 months, with monthly reporting. RGPD-compliant, data hosted in France.

Would you have 15 minutes this week to explore if this fits [COMPANY]'s prevention strategy?

### To HR Directors

**Subject:** Daily AI coaching for employee wellness — 3-minute morning calls

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

Quick question: what percentage of your employees actually use your wellness app?

Industry average is 12%. We're seeing 87% with a completely different approach: instead of waiting for employees to open an app, we call them every morning for a 3-minute check-in.

Call Me Maybe is an AI coach that helps employees build healthy habits through daily voice calls. It costs €3-5/employee/month and requires zero HR overhead.

Would a 15-minute demo make sense? I can show you exactly what a call sounds like.

Best,
Aaron Besnainou
Co-founder, Call Me Maybe

### To Gym Chains

**Subject:** A digital coaching layer for your members — zero operational cost

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

What happens to your members between gym sessions? For most, nothing — which is why 50% churn within 6 months.

We built Call Me Maybe: an AI that calls gym members every morning to check in on their nutrition, goals, and habits. It keeps them engaged 7 days a week, not just the 2-3 days they come to the gym.

Partnership is simple: we add €3-5/month to premium memberships, revenue share, zero operational cost for you.

Currently looking for a pilot partner with 5-10 clubs. Can I send you a quick one-pager?

Best,
Aaron Besnainou

### Follow-Up (if no response after 5 days)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject] — quick follow-up

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

Just bumping this in case it got buried. I know [COMPANY] is focused on [recent initiative/news if known], and I think daily AI coaching could complement that perfectly.

Happy to send a 1-page summary or do a 10-minute call at your convenience.

Best,
Aaron
