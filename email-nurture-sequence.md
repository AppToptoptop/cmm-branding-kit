**Subject:** You're on the list 🎯
**Preview:** Your spot is secured. Here's what happens next.

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Welcome to Call Me Maybe.

You just joined [WAITLIST_COUNT] people who are tired of diet apps that sit unopened on their phone.

Here's what's different about us: **we call YOU**.

Every morning, at the time you choose, your phone rings. It's your AI coach — checking in on your goals, your meals, your mood. No app to open. No willpower needed.

**What happens next:**
1. We're launching in March 2026 in France
2. Waitlist members get early access + founder pricing (up to 40% off forever)
3. You'll receive 6 more emails over the next 3 weeks with tips, science, and sneak peeks

Talk soon,
Aaron
Co-founder, Call Me Maybe

## Email 1: The Problem (Day 2)

**Subject:** Why 95% of diets fail (it's not what you think)
**Preview:** The real reason has nothing to do with food.

**Body:**

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Quick question: have you ever known *what* to eat... but still couldn't stick to it?

You're not alone. Research shows that **95% of diets fail** — not because the diet is wrong, but because there's no accountability.

Think about it:
- You download a calorie tracker → you stop logging after 4 days
- You buy a meal plan → you follow it for a week, then life happens
- You join a Facebook group → motivation fades after the initial excitement

The missing piece isn't information. It's **someone checking in on you every single day**.

That's why we built Call Me Maybe. Instead of waiting for you to open an app, we call you. Every morning. At your chosen time.

Studies show that daily accountability makes you **2.7x more likely** to reach your goals than self-monitoring alone.

Tomorrow, I'll share the science behind why voice calls work better than text or chat.

## Email 2: The Science (Day 4)

**Subject:** Your brain responds differently to a phone call
**Preview:** Why voice > text for behavior change

**Body:**

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Here's something most health apps get wrong: they rely on **text notifications**.

But your brain processes a phone call completely differently:

📞 **Voice creates social obligation** — when someone calls you, there's an innate human response to answer and be present. A push notification? Easy to swipe away.

📞 **Voice builds emotional connection** — research from Stanford shows that voice interactions create 2x more trust than text-based communication.

📞 **Voice demands real-time commitment** — you can't "do it later." The call is now. You engage now.

This is why we chose phone calls over chat, notifications, or in-app reminders.

Your AI coach calls you at 7am (or whatever time you pick). You answer. You spend 3-5 minutes reviewing your goals, your meals, your wins from yesterday. And you start your day with intention.

It's the simplest habit you'll ever build: just answer the phone.

Coming up next: how we designed the AI personality (and why it matters more than you think).

## Email 3: The Persona (Day 7)

**Subject:** Meet your future coach
**Preview:** We tested 5 personality types. One won by a landslide.

**Body:**

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

When we started building Call Me Maybe, we had a big question: **what should the AI coach sound like?**

We tested 5 archetypes:
- 🔥 The Drill Sergeant — tough love, no excuses
- 🤗 The Best Friend — all positivity, zero pressure
- 🧠 The Wise Mentor — philosophical, slow-paced
- 🎉 The Hype Coach — over-the-top energy every call
- 💪 The Warm Coach — supportive but honest. Celebrates wins, calls out BS.

The winner? **The Warm Coach** — by a landslide.

Users told us: "I don't need someone screaming at me. I need someone who genuinely cares but won't let me make excuses."

That's exactly what we built. Your coach is:
- Warm but direct
- Celebrates every small win (even drinking water)
- Gently challenges excuses ("You said you'd walk today — what got in the way?")
- Adapts to YOUR personality over time

You'll meet your coach on launch day. And you'll be surprised how quickly you start looking forward to that morning call.

## Email 4: Social Proof (Day 10)

**Subject:** "I lost 4kg in 3 weeks just by answering the phone"
**Preview:** Early beta tester results are in.

**Body:**

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Our beta testers have been using Call Me Maybe for 3 weeks now. Here are some early results:

**Sophie, 34, Lyon:**
"I've tried Noom, WW, calorie counting. Nothing stuck. With CMM, I just answer my phone at 7:30am. My coach asks what I ate, how I slept, if I moved. It takes 4 minutes. I've lost 4kg and I don't feel like I'm dieting."

**Marc, 41, Paris:**
"The streak system got me hooked. I'm on a 19-day streak. Missing a call feels like breaking a Duolingo streak — I just can't do it."

**Camille, 28, Bordeaux:**
"What surprised me: I actually look forward to the call. It's like having a friend who genuinely cares about my health. Except this friend never cancels."

Early data:
- **87% daily answer rate** (industry avg for health apps: 20% daily open rate)
- **Average streak: 14 days** (vs 4 days for typical diet apps)
- **73% report feeling more motivated** after just 1 week

These are real people, real results. And they're paying €9.90/month.

Your spot is waiting.

## Email 5: Pricing & Urgency (Day 14)

**Subject:** Founder pricing disappears at launch
**Preview:** €5.90/mo instead of €9.90 — but only for waitlist members.

**Body:**

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Quick update: we're finalizing our launch pricing and I wanted you to know first.

**Regular pricing (at launch):**
- Starter: €9.90/month
- Pro: €14.90/month
- Duo: €24.90/month (for couples)

**Waitlist-only founder pricing (locked forever):**
- Starter: €5.90/month (40% off)
- Pro: €8.90/month (40% off)
- Duo: €14.90/month (40% off)

This isn't a discount that expires. It's **founder pricing — locked for life** as long as you stay subscribed.

Why? Because you believed in us before we launched. You took a chance on a new idea. And we want to reward that.

Founder pricing is available to the first 500 waitlist members who convert at launch. You're currently number [POSITION] on the list.

Launch is coming in March 2026. You'll get first access.

— Aaron

P.S. — Know someone who'd love this? Forward this email. They'll get the same founder pricing.
