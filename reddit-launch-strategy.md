# Call Me Maybe — Reddit Launch Strategy

> How to use Reddit for organic growth, community feedback, and early user acquisition.
> Focus: r/loseit, r/getdisciplined, r/SideProject, r/startups, r/EntrepreneurRideAlong + French subreddits

## Reddit Philosophy

Reddit hates self-promotion. Reddit loves:
- Genuine stories
- Building in public
- Asking for honest feedback
- Helping others before yourself
- Data and results

**Rule #1: Be a person first, a founder second.**

## Phase 1: Build Karma & Credibility (Weeks 1-4)

### Daily Actions (15 min/day)
- Comment genuinely on 3-5 posts in r/loseit and r/getdisciplined
- Share helpful accountability tips (NO mention of CMM)
- Upvote and engage with others' progress posts
- Answer questions about motivation, habits, routine building

### Comment Templates (Pure Value, No Promotion)

**For "I can't stay motivated" threads:**
> Something that changed everything for me: external accountability. Not willpower, not motivation — just having someone check in on you every day. Whether it's a friend, a partner, or even an alarm with a question prompt. The key is making it unavoidable — something you have to actively engage with, not passively ignore like a notification.

**For "What's your morning routine?" threads:**
> I've started doing a quick 3-minute check-in every morning before anything else. I ask myself: what did I eat yesterday, did I move, what's my one goal today. When I do this out loud (even talking to myself), it sticks way better than journaling. Something about hearing your own voice makes it real.

**For "Nothing works for me" threads:**
> Unpopular opinion: the "what" doesn't matter nearly as much as the "with who." I've seen people succeed on keto, CICO, IF, Mediterranean — the ones who stuck with it all had one thing in common: daily accountability. Someone or something checking in on them every single day. Not weekly weigh-ins. Not monthly check-ins. Daily.

**For "Accountability partner wanted" threads:**
> This is the way. I've been obsessed with the idea of daily accountability for weight loss. The research is wild — 2.7x better outcomes with daily external check-ins vs self-monitoring. The problem with human accountability partners is life gets in the way. They get busy, they forget, they stop. That's actually why I've been exploring AI-based solutions for this.

## Phase 2: Founder Story Post (Week 4-5)

### Post on r/loseit

**Title:** "I was so frustrated with diet apps that I built something completely different — an AI that actually calls you on the phone every morning"

**Body (800-1000 words):**

Structure:
1. **Personal struggle** (2 paragraphs): Your own or close friend's weight loss journey. Downloaded every app. Nothing stuck. The apps all relied on you opening them.
2. **The insight** (1 paragraph): Realized the problem wasn't information — it was accountability. The most successful weight loss stories all had daily check-ins with someone.
3. **The question** (1 paragraph): "What if instead of waiting for you to open an app, the app called YOU?" Not a notification. An actual phone call.
4. **What we built** (2 paragraphs): Quick description of CMM. Daily AI phone calls. Streak system. Adapts to your personality. Costs 10x less than a human coach.
5. **Early results** (1 paragraph): Beta tester data — 87% answer rate, 14-day average streak, etc.
6. **Ask for feedback** (1 paragraph): "I'd love your honest thoughts. Would you actually answer a call from an AI coach? What would make you hang up? What would keep you engaged?"

**CRITICAL**: End with questions, not a CTA. Reddit respects genuine feedback requests.

### Post on r/SideProject

**Title:** "I built an AI that calls you every morning to keep you accountable on weight loss — here's what I learned"

**Body:** More technical/building-in-public angle:
- Tech stack (VAPI.ai for voice, Supabase, Next.js)
- Biggest challenges (getting people to answer unknown numbers → branded caller ID solution)
- Pricing decisions (€9.90/mo sweet spot)
- Early metrics
- What's next

### Post on r/getdisciplined

**Title:** "I tested daily AI phone calls for accountability for 30 days. Here are my honest results."

**Body:** Personal experiment angle:
- Set up daily calls at 7am
- What each call looked like (3-5 min check-in)
- Day-by-day experience (novelty → habit → looking forward to it)
- Results: streak, mindset shift, actual weight/habit changes
- Honest downsides and what needs improvement

## Rules to Follow

### DO:

- ✅ Share data and results transparently
- ✅ Respond to every comment on your posts
- ✅ Upvote others, celebrate their wins
- ✅ Use Reddit's formatting (bold, bullets, headers)

### DON'T:

- ❌ Post the same thing in multiple subreddits
- ❌ Use marketing language ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- ❌ Ignore criticism — address it head-on
- ❌ Buy upvotes or use vote manipulation
- ❌ Post during US night hours (Reddit is US-centric)
- ❌ Argue with trolls

### Best Posting Times:
- **US audience**: 6-9am EST (11am-2pm Paris time)
- **Global peak**: 8am EST (1pm Paris time)
- **Avoid**: Weekends for startup subs, Friday nights
