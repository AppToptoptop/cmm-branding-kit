## Ratings & Reviews Strategy

### Getting First Reviews (Critical for ASO)

**Week 1-2 targets: 20+ reviews, 4.5+ average**

| Source | Expected Reviews | How |
|--------|------------------|-----|
| Beta testers | 10-15 | Direct ask after 7-day streak |
| Friends & family | 5-10 | Personal request |
| Early waitlist users | 10-20 | In-app prompt after positive call |

### In-App Review Prompt Strategy

**Trigger review prompt when:**
- User completes 7-day streak (positive moment)
- User logs a weight milestone
- After a call where user says they're happy with progress
- NEVER after a bad day or missed call

**Prompt text:**
"You've been on a 7-day streak! Your consistency is inspiring. Would you take 30 seconds to share your experience on the App Store? It helps others find us."

### Responding to Reviews

- Respond to EVERY review within 24 hours
- Negative reviews: acknowledge, apologize, offer to fix via email
- Positive reviews: thank them, highlight a specific point
- NEVER argue with reviewers
