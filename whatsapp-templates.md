## 1. Launch Day Broadcasts

### To Personal Network (Friends & Family)

```
Hey! 🚀

After months of building, we just launched Call Me Maybe — an AI coach that calls you every morning to help with weight loss.

Not an app. An actual phone call. 3 minutes. Daily.

We're live on Product Hunt today and would LOVE your support:
→ [Product Hunt link]

Just upvote + leave a comment if you can. It takes 30 seconds and means the world to us.

If you know someone who's struggling with weight loss consistency, share this with them:
→ callmemaybe.app

Merci 🙏
— Aaron
```

### To Waitlist Subscribers

```
It's here. 📞

Call Me Maybe is officially live!

You signed up early, so you get priority:
→ 7-day FREE trial + 20% off your first month (code: EARLY20)

Download & start your first call:
→ callmemaybe.app/start

Your phone will ring tomorrow morning at your chosen time. Answer it — it's your new AI coach, Maya.

Questions? Reply here, I answer personally.

— Aaron, Co-founder
```

### To Beta Testers

```
We did it! 🎉

Call Me Maybe just launched — and YOU helped make it happen.

As a beta tester, you have:
✅ 3 months free (already active)
✅ Founding Member badge
✅ Ambassador program access

One big ask: can you leave us a review today?
→ App Store: [link]
→ Google Play: [link]

Your honest review = our best marketing. Even 2 sentences make a huge difference.

And if you post about it on social media today, tag @callmemaybe.app — we'll repost 💪

Thank you for believing in us from day one.

— Aaron & Ata

## 2. Beta Tester Management

### Welcome Message (After Acceptance)

```
Hey [NAME]! Welcome to the CMM beta 🎉

Quick setup (takes 1 minute):

1. Save this number in your contacts as "Maya - Call Me Maybe"
2. Your first call will be TOMORROW at [TIME]
3. After each call, I'll send you a quick feedback link here

Join our Discord for the beta community:

Any questions, just message me here. I'm Aaron, co-founder — I read every message personally.

Let's do this! 💪
```

### Daily Feedback Reminder (Automated After Each Call)

```
Hey [NAME]! How was today's call with Maya? 📞

Quick feedback (2 min):
→ [Google Form / Typeform link]

Your honest input = better product for everyone. Even "it was fine" is useful.

Streak: Day [X] 🔥
```

### Missed Call Follow-Up

```
Hey [NAME], I noticed you missed today's call.

No stress at all — life happens! Your streak is safe (we have a 2-hour grace period).

A few things that might help:
📱 Make sure [CMM_NUMBER] is saved in your contacts
🔔 Check your phone isn't on Do Not Disturb at call time
⏰ Want to change your call time? Just tell me

See you tomorrow morning 💪
```

### Day 7 Personal Check-In

```
[NAME]! One week of daily coaching calls — you're amazing 🎯

Quick question: what's been the biggest surprise so far?

I'm collecting feedback from all beta testers this week. Would love to hear your honest take — even 2-3 sentences help a ton.

Also: would you be open to a 5-min call with me (human Aaron, not AI Maya 😄) sometime this week?

If yes, pick a time:
→ [Calendly link]

— Aaron
```

### Day 14 Completion & Thank You

```
[NAME]!! 14 days 🔥🔥🔥

You just completed the full beta challenge. Do you know what that means?

→ You're in the top 5% of people who start ANY health program
→ You've earned Founding Member status
→ You get 3 months free CMM access
→ A Presto Fresco pizza voucher is on its way 🍕

One last thing: would you be comfortable sharing a short testimonial? Just 2-3 sentences about your experience.

Example: "I've tried every app. CMM is the first one that actually checked in on me every day. After 14 days, I feel more consistent than I have in years."

Feel free to write your own version — or I can draft something based on your feedback and you just approve it.

You're incredible. Thank you for being part of this.

— Aaron
```

## 3. Partner Outreach

### To Presto Fresco (Pizza Partnership)

```
Salut [NAME]!

Aaron from Call Me Maybe here — we're building an AI coaching app for weight loss and we have an unusual proposition:

We want to reward our influencers and beta testers with YOUR pizzas instead of cash 🍕

Here's the deal:
- We buy pizzas from you (real orders, real revenue)
- Influencers post about their "reward pizza" on Instagram/TikTok
- You get tagged in every post = free visibility
- We feature you as our launch partner on our website

We're talking 15-30 pizzas/month to start, growing as we scale.

Interested? I can explain more over a quick call.

— Aaron

### To Nano Influencers (First Contact)

```
Hey [NAME]! 👋

I've been following your content on [PLATFORM] — really love your approach to [SPECIFIC_CONTENT_TOPIC].

I'm Aaron, co-founder of Call Me Maybe — a new AI coach that calls you every morning for weight loss accountability. We're launching in France soon.

Would you be open to trying it for free? No strings attached — just curious if you find value in it.

If you love it and want to share your experience, we'd also hook you up with a pizza from Presto Fresco 🍕

Interested?
```

### To Podcast Hosts

```
Hey [NAME]!

Big fan of [PODCAST_NAME] — especially the episode about [SPECIFIC_TOPIC].

I'm building something that might interest your audience: an AI that calls people every morning for weight loss accountability. Not a chatbot — an actual phone call.

87% of our users answer every single day (vs 15% for health app notifications).

Would love to come on as a guest and share:
- Why we chose PHONE CALLS over app notifications
- The science of daily accountability (2.7x better outcomes)
- Building an AI health startup in France

Happy to send more info if you're curious.

## 5. Ongoing User Engagement

### Streak Milestone Celebrations

**Day 7:**
```
🔥 7-DAY STREAK!

[NAME], you just hit one full week of daily coaching calls.

Fun fact: 80% of people who download a health app stop using it within the first week. You didn't.

Keep going — the magic really starts at Day 14 💪
```

**Day 14:**
```
🏆 14 DAYS, [NAME]!

Two full weeks of showing up every morning. Research says it takes 14-21 days to form a habit — you're right in the sweet spot.

You're officially in the top 10% of CMM users. Incredible.

Reward unlocked: share your streak screenshot and tag @callmemaybe.app for a surprise 🎁
```

**Day 30:**
```
⭐ 30 DAYS ⭐

[NAME]. One full month. I don't even know what to say.

You answered 30 phone calls. You showed up 30 times. You chose yourself 30 mornings in a row.

You're in the top 3% of all CMM users. Ambassador status unlocked.

Feeling generous? A quick App Store review would mean the world to us:
→ [App Store link]
```

### Re-Engagement (After 3+ Missed Days)

```
Hey [NAME] 👋

It's been a few days since we last talked. No judgment — life gets busy.

Just wanted you to know: Maya is still here, ready when you are. Your progress isn't lost — even a reset is a fresh start.

Want to restart tomorrow morning? Just reply "YES" and I'll schedule your call.

Your streak resets, but your growth doesn't. 💛

— Aaron
```

### Referral Request

```
Hey [NAME]!

Quick question: do you know someone who's been wanting to get healthier but keeps struggling with consistency?

If you invite them to try CMM, you both get:
✅ 1 free month added to your account
🍕 A Presto Fresco pizza voucher

Your personal invite link:
→ callmemaybe.app/ref/[YOUR_CODE]

Just send it to one person. That's all 🙌
```
