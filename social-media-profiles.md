### Company Page

**Name:** Call Me Maybe
**Tagline:** AI Accountability Coach — Daily Phone Calls for Weight Loss
**Industry:** Health, Wellness & Fitness
**Company Size:** 2-10
**Type:** Startup

**About (2000 chars max):**
```
Call Me Maybe is an AI accountability coach that proactively calls users every morning for weight loss support.

Unlike traditional health apps that rely on users to open them (15-20% daily engagement), our AI coach picks up the phone and calls you. The result: 87% daily engagement and 2.7x better outcomes than self-monitoring.

THE PROBLEM
95% of diets fail. Not because people lack knowledge — because they lack daily accountability. The gap between knowing what to eat and actually doing it is the #1 reason people don't reach their health goals.

THE SOLUTION
Every morning, your phone rings. It's Maya, your AI coach. In 3 minutes, she reviews yesterday's meals, movement, and mood. You commit to one action for today. You build a streak. That's it.

WHY IT WORKS
- Voice coaching creates 56% more weight loss than text-based apps (peer-reviewed research)
- Daily check-ins make users 2.7x more likely to reach their goals
- Streak gamification drives 5x retention (the Duolingo model, applied to health)

FRANCE FIRST
Based in Paris. French-speaking AI. RGPD-compliant with data hosted in France (OVHcloud). No competitor offers AI phone calls for weight loss in the French market.

PRICING
Starting at €9.90/month — 10x cheaper than a human coach, 86% cheaper than Noom.

B2B
We also offer corporate wellness programs for companies and mutuelles. Contact us for pilot programs.

Founded in 2026 by Aaron Besnainou and Ata.

## Launch Day Social Posts

### Twitter/X Launch Thread
```
Thread: 🧵 Today we're launching Call Me Maybe.

1/ We built an AI that calls you every morning.

Not a notification. Not a chatbot. An actual phone call.

2/ Here's why: 95% of diets fail because there's no daily accountability.

You KNOW what to eat. But knowing ≠ doing.

3/ So we asked: what if an AI coach called you every morning for a 3-minute check-in?

- How was yesterday?
- What's your goal today?
- Let's keep that streak going.

4/ The results: 87% of users answer every single day.

Compare that to 15-20% for health app notifications.

5/ We're launching on Product Hunt today.

France-first 🇫🇷 | €9.90/month | 7-day free trial

### LinkedIn Launch Post
```
Today, we're launching Call Me Maybe.

After months of research and building, we're releasing an AI accountability coach that does something no health app has done before: it calls you.

Every morning. A real phone call. 3 minutes.

Why? Because 95% of diets fail — not from lack of knowledge, but lack of daily accountability.

Traditional health apps have a 15-20% daily engagement rate. Our approach: 87%.

We're starting in France, where no competitor offers AI phone coaching for weight loss. RGPD-compliant, data hosted in France.

€9.90/month. 7-day free trial.
