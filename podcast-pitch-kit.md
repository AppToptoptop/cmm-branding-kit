## 1. Generic Pitch (Master Template)

**Subject line:** What happens when an AI coach calls your phone every morning?

---

Hi [Host Name],

I'm a listener of [Podcast Name] and particularly enjoyed your episode on [specific episode/topic]. Your perspective on [relevant angle] resonated with something we're building.

I'm Aaron, co-founder of Call Me Maybe -- an AI accountability coach that calls users on the phone every single day to support their weight loss journey. Not a push notification. Not a chatbot. An actual phone call.

Here's the hook: what if your phone rang every morning with an AI coach asking about your breakfast?

The timing matters. 95% of diets fail. Research shows that phone-based coaching produces 56% more weight loss than app-only solutions, and people with an accountability partner are 2.7x more likely to reach their goals. Noom built a $400M/year business on psychology-based coaching -- but they still rely on text. We believe voice is the missing piece.

In France, mental health has been declared "Grande Cause Nationale" for 2025-2026, obesity costs are approaching 13 billion euros annually, and Wegovy just launched. The demand for accessible, daily coaching has never been higher.

I'd love to share how we're rethinking weight loss coaching -- 20 minutes, your format.

Best,
Aaron Besnainou
Co-Founder, Call Me Maybe

## 2. Personalized Pitches for 6 French Podcasts

---

### 2a. Dans la Poire! -- Host: Charles Brumauld

**Subject line:** The psychology of a daily phone call vs. a food diary

---

Hi Charles,

I've been following Dans la Poire and your approach to psycho-nutrition -- the idea that our relationship with food matters more than what's on the plate. You articulate something that the diet industry keeps ignoring.

I'm Aaron, co-founder of Call Me Maybe. We built an AI coach that calls users on the phone every day to support their weight loss -- and the results confirm what you've been saying. It's not about the meal plan. It's about daily accountability.

Here's what the research shows: phone-based coaching produces 56% more weight loss than apps alone. Voice triggers oxytocin release and reduces cortisol in ways that text-based food diaries simply cannot. The daily call creates a psychological contract -- missing it feels like standing someone up, not ignoring a notification.

As a dietitian, you understand the gap between knowing what to eat and actually doing it. I'd love to discuss why a phone call might be more powerful than a food diary for bridging that gap -- 20 minutes, your format.

Best,
Aaron Besnainou
Co-Founder, Call Me Maybe

### 2b. Le Reequilibrage Alimentaire -- Host: Mael Brossaud

**Subject line:** The accountability gap no one in nutrition talks about

---

Hi Mael,

Your work on Le Reequilibrage Alimentaire tackles something fundamental -- behavior change is harder than diet planning. As a sports coach, you know that knowledge without consistency is worthless.

I'm Aaron, co-founder of Call Me Maybe. We're building an AI accountability coach that calls users daily by phone to support their weight loss. Not an app notification. A real phone call.

Here's the problem we're solving: 95% of diets fail, and it's rarely because the plan was wrong. It's because nobody checks in. Research shows people with an accountability partner are 2.7x more likely to reach their goals, and phone-based coaching delivers 56% more weight loss than tech alone.

Your audience already has the nutritional knowledge. What they're missing is someone calling them every morning to ask, "Did you follow through?" That's the accountability gap.

I'd love to discuss why daily phone calls beat diet plans -- 20 minutes, your format.

Best,
Aaron Besnainou
Co-Founder, Call Me Maybe

### 2c. Savoir Manger

**Subject line:** How AI coaching is disrupting weight loss -- and why France is different

---

Hi there,

Savoir Manger has built a trusted voice in the French nutrition landscape, helping listeners navigate the gap between food culture and healthy living. That cultural nuance is exactly why France is where we launched.

I'm Aaron, co-founder of Call Me Maybe -- an AI coach that calls users daily by phone for weight loss support. We chose France first because the French market requires a fundamentally different approach. "Regime" doesn't work here -- "equilibre alimentaire" does.

The numbers are striking: French obesity costs are approaching 13 billion euros annually, Wegovy launched in October 2024, and mental health is the "Grande Cause Nationale" for 2025-2026. Yet Noom ($400M/year revenue) barely operates in France. The market is wide open for a culturally adapted solution.

Our approach: daily voice coaching that respects the French relationship with food while leveraging AI personalization at scale.

I'd love to share why AI coaching in France requires a completely different playbook -- 20 minutes, your format.

Best,
Aaron Besnainou
Co-Founder, Call Me Maybe

### 2d. Sport et Nutrition Naturelle

**Subject line:** Beyond meal plans: voice calls that change behavior

---

Hi there,

Sport et Nutrition Naturelle brings a refreshing perspective -- that sustainable fitness and nutrition aren't about perfection but about building real habits. That philosophy is exactly what our product is built on.

I'm Aaron, co-founder of Call Me Maybe. We created an AI coach that calls users on the phone every morning to support their weight loss. The insight behind it is simple: behavior change requires proactive intervention, not passive tracking.

Here's what the research says: voice triggers oxytocin release and reduces cortisol -- neurochemical effects that push notifications can never produce. Phone-based coaching adds 56% more weight loss compared to app-only solutions. And a daily call creates a streak-based habit loop inspired by Duolingo, whose streak system increased retention from 12% to 55%.

Your listeners train their bodies. But the hardest muscle to train is consistency. That's what a daily phone call is for.

I'd love to discuss how proactive voice calls create lasting behavior change -- 20 minutes, your format.

Best,
Aaron Besnainou
Co-Founder, Call Me Maybe

### 2e. La Voix de la Nutrition -- Host: Julia

**Subject line:** Making nutrition personal with daily voice coaching

---

Hi Julia,

La Voix de la Nutrition is a perfect name for what we're building. Your focus on making nutrition accessible and personal mirrors our conviction that the best coaching isn't found in an app -- it's heard in a voice.

I'm Aaron, co-founder of Call Me Maybe. We've built an AI accountability coach that calls users daily by phone to support their weight loss. The daily call asks three questions: What did you eat? Did you move? How are you feeling? -- then adapts the coaching based on patterns over time.

As a dietitian, you know that the human touch matters. Research from UT Austin shows that voice creates significantly stronger bonds than text, even when people predict they'd prefer texting. Our users don't ignore us the way they ignore apps -- because a ringing phone feels like someone who cares.

The irony: it takes AI to bring the human touch back to nutrition coaching at scale.

I'd love to discuss how daily voice coaching makes nutrition personal -- 20 minutes, your format.

Best,
Aaron Besnainou
Co-Founder, Call Me Maybe

### 2f. Sante 360 -- Host: Dr. Stephane Resimont

**Subject line:** Phone-based coaching as a preventive health tool

---

Dr. Resimont,

Your integrative approach on Sante 360 -- looking at hormonal balance, metabolic health, and longevity as a system -- is exactly how we think about weight loss. It's not a cosmetic problem. It's a health infrastructure problem.

I'm Aaron, co-founder of Call Me Maybe. We've built an AI coach that calls users daily by phone for weight loss accountability. But what we're really building is a preventive health tool.

Here's why this matters from a clinical perspective: daily phone-based coaching produces 56% more weight loss than tech alone. People with accountability support maintain their results at nearly 3x the rate. And because we use voice, we're collecting data that goes beyond calories -- vocal biomarkers can detect stress, emotional eating patterns, and mood shifts over time.

In France, obesity costs 12.7 billion euros annually and Wegovy just launched. The missing piece isn't medication -- it's daily behavioral support. That's where a phone call fits into the preventive health stack.

I'd love to share our early data and discuss phone coaching as a complement to metabolic health management -- 20 minutes, your format.

Best,
Aaron Besnainou
Co-Founder, Call Me Maybe

## 3. Talking Points Cheat Sheet

### 3 Key Messages (Hit These Every Time)

1. **The phone call is the product.** "We don't send notifications. We call you. That's the entire difference. A ringing phone creates a psychological contract that no app can match."

2. **Voice works because of neuroscience, not novelty.** "Voice triggers oxytocin and reduces cortisol. Phone-based coaching produces 56% more weight loss than apps alone. This isn't a gimmick -- it's biology."

3. **France is the right market at the right time.** "Mental health is the Grande Cause Nationale, Wegovy just launched, and obesity costs France nearly 13 billion euros a year. There's no French-first AI coaching product. We're building it."

---

### 5 Soundbites / Quotable One-Liners

1. "You can ignore a notification. You can't ignore a ringing phone."

2. "95% of diets fail. But 95% of people don't have someone calling them every morning to ask, 'How was breakfast?'"

3. "We took the most annoying thing about your phone -- an incoming call -- and turned it into the most helpful."

4. "Noom proved the market at $400 million a year. We're proving that voice is the missing channel."

5. "The best accountability partner is the one who shows up every single day. That's what AI makes possible."

### 5 Common Questions & Suggested Answers

**Q1: "Isn't an AI call impersonal? Why would people pick up?"**

A: "Great question. You'd think so, but research from UT Austin shows people form stronger bonds through voice than through text -- even with AI. Our users pick up because they chose the call time, they chose the coach personality, and after a few days, it becomes a ritual. Missing the call feels like standing someone up. That's the power of voice over push notifications."

**Q2: "How is this different from Noom or other coaching apps?"**

A: "Noom is text-based. You read articles, log food manually, and occasionally message a human coach who manages 300 other people. We call you. Every day. By phone. The coaching is proactive, not reactive. And the data backs it up: phone-based interventions produce 56% more weight loss than tech-only approaches. We're not competing with Noom's model -- we're building the next one."

**Q3: "Why France first instead of the US?"**

A: "Three reasons. First, France declared mental health the Grande Cause Nationale for 2025-2026 -- there's cultural momentum. Second, Wegovy just launched in France and there's no behavioral support product to pair with it. Third, France has strict data privacy laws (RGPD) that most US competitors won't bother complying with. That regulation is our moat."

**Q4: "What if people get tired of daily calls?"**

A: "We studied Duolingo's streak model extensively. Their streaks increased retention from 12% to 55%. We use the same psychology: loss aversion. Once you have a 14-day streak going, you don't want to break it. And the calls are short -- 3 to 5 minutes. It's not a therapy session. It's a check-in. Like a quick coffee with your coach."

**Q5: "Is AI really capable of being a good coach?"**

A: "It's not about replacing human coaches. It's about access. A human nutritionist in France costs 50 to 80 euros per session. Most people can't afford weekly sessions, let alone daily ones. AI makes daily coaching accessible for under a euro a day. And the AI learns your patterns over time -- it notices that you overeat on Sundays, that stress at work triggers snacking, that you sleep badly after late dinners. No human coach sees that level of data."

### The "Aha Moment" Story

*Use this when the host asks "How did you come up with this idea?" or "What's the origin story?"*

"My co-founder Ata and I were looking at the weight loss market and one stat kept haunting us: 95% of diets fail. Not because the plans are bad. Not because people lack information -- there are a million free meal plans online. Diets fail because on day 14, nobody is there to ask you how it's going.

Then we looked at the research. Phone-based coaching produces 56% more weight loss than apps alone. Accountability partners nearly triple your chances of success. And voice -- actual human voice -- triggers neurochemical bonding that text can never match.

So we asked: what if your phone rang every morning at 7am, and an AI coach asked, 'Hey, how was dinner last night? Did you move today? How are you feeling?' Not a notification you swipe away. A call you actually answer.

We built a prototype, tested it on ourselves, and something unexpected happened. We started looking forward to the call. That's when we knew we had something."
