## 1. Beta Tester Profile

### Ideal Beta Tester
- **Age:** 25-45
- **Location:** France (for French-language coaching)
- **Goal:** Wants to lose 5-20kg
- **Tech comfort:** Uses smartphone daily, comfortable with phone calls
- **Availability:** Can answer a 3-minute call every morning for 14+ days
- **Communication:** Willing to give honest feedback (not just "it's great")
- **Bonus:** Active on social media (potential future testimonials)

### Anti-Profile (Avoid)
- People who just want free stuff with no intent to engage
- Anyone with a history of eating disorders (we're not equipped for clinical support)
- People who won't answer daily calls
- Technical testers only interested in finding bugs (we need user experience feedback)

I'm building an AI that calls you every morning for weight loss accountability.

Not an app notification. An actual phone call. 3 minutes. Daily.

We're looking for 20 beta testers in France to try it for free for 2 weeks.

What you get: free access (3 months), direct founder access, pizza perks.
What we need: honest feedback on the calls.

If you've tried diets/apps and struggled with consistency, you're exactly who this is for.

DM me if interested. Spots are limited.

### Email 1: Welcome (Immediately after acceptance)

**Subject:** You're in! Welcome to the CMM beta 🎉

```
Hey [NAME],

Welcome to Call Me Maybe — you're one of our first [X] beta testers. This is a big deal for us, and we're so glad you're here.

Here's what happens next:

1. TOMORROW MORNING: Your phone will ring at [PREFERRED_TIME]. It's Maya, your AI coach. Answer the call — it's 3 minutes.

2. AFTER EACH CALL: You'll get a WhatsApp message with a quick feedback link (2 minutes). Please fill it out — your feedback is literally building this product.

3. JOIN DISCORD: [Discord invite link] — meet the other beta testers, share your experience, talk to us directly.

Quick setup:
- Save this number in your contacts: [CMM_PHONE_NUMBER] → Name it "Maya - Call Me Maybe"
- This way you'll know it's us calling (not spam!)

Your beta runs for 14 days minimum, but you'll have free access for 3 full months.

Any questions? Reply to this email — it goes straight to me (Aaron).

Let's go 🚀
— Aaron
```

### Email 2: Day 3 Check-In

**Subject:** Day 3 — how's it going?

```
Hey [NAME],

You've been getting calls from Maya for 3 days now. How's it feeling?

I have 3 quick questions (reply directly to this email):

1. What surprised you about the calls?
2. What felt weird or off?
3. On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to keep answering?

No wrong answers. The more honest you are, the better we can make this.

And hey — you're on a 3-day streak. Most people who try a diet app quit by now. You didn't. 💪

— Aaron
```

### Email 3: Day 7 — Midpoint

**Subject:** One week! Your feedback is shaping everything.

```
Hey [NAME],

7 days of daily coaching calls. You're officially in the top 20% of people who start any health program. Seriously.

Quick midpoint check:

- Your streak: [X] days
- Calls answered: [X]/7
- Average call duration: [X] min

I'd love 5 minutes of your time for a quick voice call (human this time, not AI 😄). Can we chat this week?

Pick a time: [Calendly link or "reply with your availability"]

This call helps us understand what's working and what needs to change before we launch to thousands of people. Your input = massive impact.

— Aaron
