### Variant A: French Nutritionists / Dietitians

**First DM** (280 chars)

```
Hey [NAME]! I love how you break down [THEIR_CONTENT_TOPIC] -- your approach to nutrition is so refreshing. We built an AI app that calls people daily to help them stick to their health goals. Would love to get your expert take on it. Can I send you a free access?
```

**Follow-up (if positive response)**

```
Amazing, thanks [NAME]! Here's the quick rundown:

Call Me Maybe is an AI coach that literally phones you every morning. It checks in on your goals, adjusts based on how you're feeling, and keeps you accountable -- like having a supportive friend who never forgets to follow up.

We're offering select nutritionists like you:
- Free 3-month full access
- A Presto Fresco pizza voucher (yes, a real pizza -- because balance matters)
- Zero obligation to post -- but if you love it, we'd be thrilled if you shared your honest experience

I can set you up today if you want. What email should I send the access to?
```

---

### Variant B: "Reequilibrage Alimentaire" Journey Accounts

**First DM** (294 chars)

```
Hey [NAME]! Your journey with [THEIR_CONTENT_TOPIC] is genuinely inspiring -- especially how you talk about consistency over perfection. We made an AI that calls you every day to keep you on track with your goals. Feels like it was built for people on your kind of journey. Curious?
```

**Follow-up (if positive response)**

```
So glad you're interested! Here's the deal:

Call Me Maybe is basically a daily phone call from an AI coach. Every morning, it checks in: How did yesterday go? What's the plan today? It adapts to your mood, celebrates your wins, and picks you up after setbacks.

For creators documenting their journey like you, we're offering:
- 3 months free access (no strings)
- A free pizza from Presto Fresco (earned cheat day vibes)
- If you enjoy it, you could share a Story or Reel about your experience -- but truly no pressure

Your followers are literally looking for this kind of accountability tool. Want me to set you up?
```

---

### Variant C: Mom Fitness / Wellness Accounts

**First DM** (289 chars)

```
Hey [NAME]! Just saw your post about [THEIR_CONTENT_TOPIC] and honestly, I relate so hard. We built an AI app that calls moms (and anyone really) every morning to help them stay on track with their wellness goals. Think of it as a daily check-in that actually works. Interested?
```

**Follow-up (if positive response)**

```
Love that you're open to it! Here's the short version:

Call Me Maybe calls you every morning by phone. Not a notification you swipe away -- an actual call. It asks how you're doing, what you ate, if you moved, and gently keeps you accountable. It adapts to YOUR life (because we know mom life is unpredictable).

What we'd love to offer you:
- Free 3-month access for you to genuinely try it
- A Presto Fresco pizza voucher (because you deserve a treat)
- If it clicks with your routine, maybe a Story showing your morning call? But zero pressure

I think your community of moms trying to prioritize themselves would genuinely love this. Want in?
```

---

### Variant D: Before/After Transformation Accounts

**First DM** (296 chars)

```
Hey [NAME]! Your transformation is incredible -- especially the part about [THEIR_CONTENT_TOPIC]. The thing most people don't talk about is HOW you stayed consistent. We built an AI that calls you daily to keep you accountable. Feel like it's the missing piece for your followers. Open to trying it?
```

**Follow-up (if positive response)**

```
Awesome! Here's what Call Me Maybe does:

It's an AI coach that literally calls your phone every morning. It tracks your goals, remembers your progress, celebrates milestones, and gives you a gentle push on the hard days. Think daily accountability without needing a human coach at 200 EUR/month.

For transformation creators like you:
- 3 months completely free
- A Presto Fresco pizza as a "you've earned it" reward
- If you like it, the dream content would be: "The tool that kept me accountable during my transformation" -- but only if you genuinely mean it

Your before/after is the WHAT. CMM is the HOW. Your followers always ask "how did you stay motivated?" -- this is the answer. Want me to send you access?
```

---

### Variant E: French Food / Batch Cooking Accounts

**First DM** (286 chars)

```
Hey [NAME]! Your [THEIR_CONTENT_TOPIC] content is making me hungry AND organized. Love how you make healthy eating feel doable. We created an AI that calls people daily to help them stick to their nutrition goals -- batch cooking + daily accountability = unstoppable combo. Want to test it?
```

**Follow-up (if positive response)**

```
Thanks for being open to it! Quick overview:

Call Me Maybe is an AI that calls you every morning by phone. It checks in on your nutrition goals, meal prep plans, and overall habits. If you prepped your meals on Sunday but it's Wednesday and you're slipping -- it's there to remind you WHY you started.

Here's what we'd love to offer you:
- Free 3-month access to try it yourself
- A Presto Fresco pizza voucher (the ultimate batch cooking cheat day)
- If you vibe with it, a Reel or Story showing how daily calls fit into your routine would be amazing -- but no obligation at all

Your audience already has the recipes. CMM gives them the consistency. Want me to set you up?
```

### DM Tips & Rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Never send the same DM to two influencers in the same niche | They talk to each other -- identical messages kill credibility |
| Always reference a SPECIFIC post or Story | Shows you actually follow them, not mass-DMing |
| First DM must be under 300 characters | Long first messages get ignored -- hook them, then explain |
| Never say "collab" or "partnership" in the first DM | Feels transactional -- lead with curiosity and value |
| Follow up once after 5-7 days, then stop | Respect their time -- if they're not interested, move on |
| DM between 9AM-12PM or 7PM-9PM | Highest response rates in France |
| Never DM on weekends | Lower response rates, feels intrusive |

### Template B: Podcast Guest Pitch

**Subject line:** Pitch: "I built an AI that calls you every morning to keep you accountable"

**Body:**

```
Hi [HOST_NAME],

I'm Aaron, co-founder of Call Me Maybe. Here's the one-line pitch: we built an AI that phones you every single morning to keep you on track with your weight loss and wellness goals. Not a notification. An actual phone call.

I think your listeners on [PODCAST_NAME] would find the story behind it interesting:
- Why accountability beats motivation every time
- How an AI phone call at 8AM changes behavior more than any app notification
- The surprising psychology of voice-based coaching vs. text-based apps
- Why we're targeting France first (and the cultural nuances of wellness coaching)

I've done zero podcast appearances so far -- so your audience would be hearing this story first.

Happy to do a 20-30 minute conversation, pre-record or live, whatever works for your format. Would this be a good fit for [PODCAST_NAME]?

Thanks,
Aaron
Co-founder, Call Me Maybe
[EMAIL] | [PHONE]

### Template C: Dietitian / Nutritionist Referral Partnership

**Subject line:** 20-30% commission for every client you refer to CMM

**Body:**

```
Hi [NAME],

I'm Aaron from Call Me Maybe -- an AI accountability coach that calls clients daily by phone to help them stick to their nutrition and wellness goals.

I'm reaching out because your work as a [dietitian/nutritionist] is exactly the kind of expertise our users need, and I think we can help each other:

**What CMM does for your clients:**
Your clients get a daily phone check-in between appointments. It reinforces the habits you've set, tracks their progress, and flags when they're struggling -- so you can focus on the clinical work.

**What you get:**
- 20-30% recurring commission on every client who subscribes through your referral link
- A free CMM account to test the product yourself
- Co-branded landing page if you want one
- Monthly performance reports

No upfront cost, no minimum commitment. If your clients love it, you earn. If they don't, no harm done.

Want me to set up your referral account? Takes 5 minutes.

Best,
Aaron
Co-founder, Call Me Maybe

### Email Tips

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Subject line under 50 characters | Higher open rates on mobile |
| Body under 200 words | Respect their time -- they get 50+ pitches/week |
| Send Tuesday-Thursday, 10AM-2PM | Best open rates for French professionals |
| Follow up once after 5 business days | Brief, 2-3 sentences max: "Just bumping this up -- still interested?" |
| Always include your real name + phone | Shows you're a real founder, not a bot |
| Never attach files in the first email | Attachments trigger spam filters and feel heavy |

## 3. Presto Fresco Pizza Perks Pitch

### The Model: Pizza Instead of Cash

Instead of paying nano influencers EUR 50-200 in cash for a post, CMM offers them a **free Presto Fresco pizza** after they post about their experience. This section explains the model to potential partners (both influencers and Presto Fresco).

---

### How It Works

```
1. Influencer receives free 3-month CMM access
2. Influencer tries the app genuinely for 1-2 weeks
3. Influencer posts a Story, Reel, or Post about their experience
4. CMM sends them a Presto Fresco voucher (redeemable for 1 free pizza)
5. Influencer films themselves enjoying the pizza = bonus content moment
```

---

### Why Pizza Works Better Than Cash

| Factor | Cash Payment | Pizza Perk |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Cost per influencer** | EUR 50-200 | EUR 5-8 |
| **Feels transactional?** | Yes -- "post for money" | No -- "here's a treat for being awesome" |
| **Creates extra content?** | No | Yes -- filming the pizza = another Story |
| **Shareable moment?** | No one posts about getting paid | Everyone posts about free food |
| **Brand alignment** | Neutral | Perfect -- "earned cheat day" narrative |
| **Partner benefit** | None | Presto Fresco gets tagged, linked, exposed |
| **Scalability** | Expensive at 15+ influencers | Sustainable at 50+ influencers |

---

### ROI Math

```
SCENARIO: 15 nano influencers

Pizza Perks Model:
  15 influencers x EUR 8 avg pizza cost = EUR 120 total
  + Each influencer tags Presto Fresco = 15 pieces of free content for PF
  + Pizza filming = 15 bonus content pieces for CMM

Cash Payment Model:
  15 influencers x EUR 100 avg payment = EUR 1,500 total
  + No additional content beyond the paid post
  + No partner benefits

SAVINGS: EUR 1,380 (92% cheaper)
BONUS: 30 extra content pieces (15 for CMM + 15 for Presto Fresco)
```

---

### What Presto Fresco Gets

This is the pitch to present to Presto Fresco as a partner:

| Benefit | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Tagged content** | Every influencer tags @prestofresco in their pizza Story/Reel |
| **SEO backlink** | Presto Fresco listed on CMM's partner page with a dofollow link |
| **Community exposure** | CMM users see Presto Fresco as the "official cheat day reward" |
| **Health-positive branding** | Associated with a wellness brand, not just fast food |
| **Zero advertising cost** | Presto Fresco only provides product at cost (EUR 5-8 per pizza) |
| **Content rights** | Can repost influencer content featuring their pizzas |
| **Monthly volume** | 10-20 pizzas/month = EUR 80-160 investment for dozens of social mentions |

---

### Pitch Script for Presto Fresco

```
"We're Call Me Maybe, an AI wellness coaching app launching in France.
We work with 15-30 nano influencers every month who post about
their experience with our app. Instead of paying them cash, we
want to reward them with a free Presto Fresco pizza.

Here's what's in it for you:
- Every influencer tags you in their content (Story + Reel)
- You get listed on our partner page with an SEO backlink
- Your brand becomes associated with wellness and earned rewards
- Total cost to you: 10-20 pizzas/month at cost price

You're essentially getting 15-30 pieces of organic influencer
content per month for the price of a few pizzas. No agency fees,
no contracts, no minimums."
```

---

### Influencer Perk Announcement Message

Send this after the influencer posts their content:

```
Hey [NAME]! Just saw your [Story/Reel/Post] -- it looks amazing,
thank you so much for sharing your experience!

As promised, here's your Presto Fresco pizza voucher: [LINK/CODE]

Redeem it at any Presto Fresco location. Pro tip: film yourself
enjoying it and tag @prestofresco and @callmemaybe -- your
followers will love the "earned my cheat day" vibe.

Thanks again for being part of the CMM community. We'd love to
keep working with you if you're interested.

### CALL ME MAYBE -- Content Brief

**What is Call Me Maybe?**

Call Me Maybe is an AI accountability coach that calls you by phone every morning to help you stick to your weight loss and wellness goals. It is not another notification you ignore -- it is a real phone call that checks in, tracks your progress, and keeps you consistent day after day.

---

**Key Talking Points (pick 2-3 that feel natural to you)**

- "It calls me every morning -- like having a friend who never forgets to check in on you"
- "The hardest part of any health goal isn't knowing what to do, it's actually doing it every day. CMM solves the consistency problem."
- "It's not a meal plan or a workout app. It's the accountability layer that makes everything else work."

---

**Hashtags to Use**

Include at least 2 of these in your post/caption:

```
#CallMeMaybe #DailyAccountability #AICoach
#ConsistencyOverMotivation #WellnessJourney
#HealthGoals #MorningRoutine #AccountabilityPartner
```

---

**Content Format Suggestions**

| Format | Idea | Best For |
|--------|------|----------|
| **Instagram Story (3-5 slides)** | Show your phone ringing, answer the call, share your reaction | Quick, authentic, low effort |
| **Instagram Reel (30-60s)** | "My morning routine with CMM" -- show the call as part of your day | High reach, algorithm-friendly |
| **Instagram Post (carousel)** | "3 things I learned after 7 days with an AI coach" | Evergreen, saveable content |
| **TikTok video (30-60s)** | Film yourself getting the call -- genuine reaction | Viral potential, raw and real |
| **YouTube Short or vlog segment** | Integrate CMM into a "day in my life" or "weekly check-in" | Depth, trust-building |

---

**Do's**

- Be honest -- share what you actually like (and what surprised you)
- Show the phone call moment if possible (the ringing phone = great hook)
- Mention that it is a real phone call, not just an app notification
- Tag @callmemaybe and @prestofresco (if you received the pizza perk)
- Use your own words -- no scripts required
- Share within 2 weeks of receiving your access code

---

**Don'ts**

- Do not read from a script or sound rehearsed
- Do not make medical claims ("this app will make you lose X kg")
- Do not compare CMM to specific competitors by name
- Do not share your access code or referral link publicly unless we provide one
- Do not post if you did not actually try the app -- authenticity is everything
- Do not forget to disclose the partnership (use #ad or #gifted per local regulations)
