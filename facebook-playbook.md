# Facebook Group Infiltration Playbook — Call Me Maybe

> Systematic 8-week plan to build authority in French weight loss Facebook groups and convert engaged members into CMM early adopters.

---

## 1. Profile Setup

### Personal Profile Optimization

Your personal Facebook profile is your landing page. Every comment you leave in a group sends people to your profile first. It needs to tell a story before you ever mention CMM.

**Display Name:** Use your real name (Aaron Besnainou). Authenticity is non-negotiable. Fake profiles get flagged and banned.

**Bio / Intro Section:**
- Current city: Paris, France
- Work: "Building something to help people stay accountable" (vague enough to intrigue, honest enough to not feel salesy)
- Education: Keep real
- Relationship status: Optional but humanizes you
- Life events: Add a "Started a new project" event dated to when CMM began

**Founder Story Elements to Weave Into Your Bio:**
- Personal struggle with consistency (not necessarily weight loss — could be fitness, habits, productivity)
- The realization that willpower alone fails and external accountability changes everything
- A line like: "I believe a daily phone call can change someone's life. Building the proof."
- Avoid any mention of "CEO" or "Founder" — those titles repel community members. Use "I'm building..." language instead.

**Profile Photo Guidance:**
- High-quality headshot, natural light, genuine smile
- Casual but put-together (no suit, no gym selfie)
- Solid or blurred background
- Face clearly visible, no sunglasses
- Ideal: a photo that looks like it was taken by a friend at a cafe, not a LinkedIn photographer

**Cover Photo Suggestion:**
- Option A: A clean lifestyle photo — morning coffee, notebook, sunrise run — something aspirational but not performative
- Option B: A simple quote graphic you made: "Consistency beats intensity. Every single time." — no CMM branding, just a value-aligned statement
- Option C: A candid photo of you working at a laptop in a casual setting (signals builder/creator without screaming startup founder)

**Featured Section:**
- Pin 1-2 public posts about accountability, habits, or personal growth (write these before joining any groups)
- A short article or note titled something like "Why I Think Accountability Is the Missing Piece" — this becomes your credibility anchor when people visit your profile

### Privacy Settings
- Make your group activity visible (so people can see you're genuinely active in communities)
- Keep personal/family photos private
- Make your "intro" and "featured" sections public

## 2. Target Groups (Top 10)

### Primary Targets — High Volume

| # | Group Name / Search Term | Est. Size | Why It Matters |
|---|--------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | **Perte de poids motivation** | 50K-200K | Largest French weight loss motivation community. High volume of daily posts. Perfect for comment farming. |
| 2 | **Rééquilibrage alimentaire** | 50K-150K | Health-focused rather than crash-diet focused. Members are more likely to value long-term solutions like accountability coaching. |
| 3 | **Régime et motivation** | 30K-100K | Classic diet + motivation crossover. Members post daily progress updates — ideal for engagement. |
| 4 | **Jeûne intermittent France** | 20K-50K | Highly engaged, method-specific community. Members are already disciplined and looking for tools to stay consistent. |
| 5 | **Comme J'aime / WW alumni** | 10K-30K | People who've tried structured programs and dropped off. They already understand the value of external structure — CMM is the next evolution. |

### Secondary Targets — High Intent

| # | Group Name / Search Term | Est. Size | Why It Matters |
|---|--------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| 6 | **Objectif poids santé** | 20K-60K | Goal-oriented language attracts members actively working toward a number. High intent, high frustration when plateaus hit. |
| 7 | **Maigrir ensemble / Perdre du poids ensemble** | 30K-80K | "Together" framing means members already crave community and accountability. Direct alignment with CMM's value prop. |
| 8 | **Sport et alimentation équilibrée** | 15K-40K | Fitness + nutrition crossover. Members are action-oriented and tech-friendly. More likely to try an app/service. |
| 9 | **Maman en forme / Maman perte de poids** | 10K-30K | Highly specific demographic (mothers). Extremely engaged, share openly, and desperately need accountability because their schedules are chaotic. |
| 10 | **Défi 30 jours / Challenge minceur** | 10K-25K | Challenge-based groups. Members are primed for structured programs with deadlines. Perfect testing ground for CMM's "7-day challenge" format. |

### How to Find Them
- Search Facebook Groups with the French terms above
- Sort by "Most Members" and "Most Active"
- Check that the group has daily posts (dead groups waste time)
- Prefer groups with active admins (they maintain quality, which means your quality content stands out more)
- Join 3-4 groups initially, expand to all 10 over weeks 1-3

### Search Terms to Try

## 3. Week-by-Week Plan (8 Weeks)

---

### Weeks 1-2: Pure Value (Zero Self-Promotion)

**Goal:** Become a recognized, helpful presence. People should start recognizing your name and associating it with useful advice.

**Daily Cadence:**
- 3-5 thoughtful comments per day across 3-4 groups
- 1 reaction/like on 10+ posts (increases your visibility in the algorithm)
- Spend 20-30 minutes total per day

**Best Times to Engage (France time):**
- Morning: 7:00-9:00 AM (people post morning weigh-ins, breakfast photos, motivation checks)
- Lunch: 12:00-1:00 PM (food-related posts spike)
- Evening: 7:00-9:00 PM (reflections on the day, meal prep posts, "I fell off today" confessions)

**10 Comment Templates — Pure Value, No CMM Mention:**

**Template 1 — Responding to "I can't lose weight no matter what I do":**
> This is so frustrating and I hear you. One thing that helped me was stopping the "all or nothing" mindset. Instead of trying to be perfect every day, I started tracking just ONE thing — whether I drank enough water. That tiny win built momentum for bigger changes. What's one small thing you could commit to this week?

**Template 2 — Responding to "I keep starting over every Monday":**
> The Monday reset trap is real. Here's what shifted things for me: I stopped treating slip-ups as failures and started treating them as data. If I overate on Wednesday, I'd ask "what happened at 3pm that triggered it?" instead of "I'll start fresh Monday." Understanding your patterns matters more than willpower.

**Template 3 — Responding to someone sharing a plateau:**
> Plateaus are genuinely the hardest part because you're doing everything right and the scale won't move. Two things worth checking: Are you eating enough? (undereating stalls metabolism) and are you sleeping enough? (cortisol from poor sleep literally blocks fat loss). The plateau almost always breaks when you address one of these.

**Template 4 — Responding to "what's your morning routine?":**
> My morning routine is embarrassingly simple: wake up, drink a big glass of water, and spend 5 minutes writing down what I'll eat today. Not a meal plan — just a rough sketch. It takes the decision fatigue out of the day. The fancier I tried to make my routine, the less I stuck with it.

**Template 5 — Responding to motivation posts:**
> Love this energy. The one thing I'd add: don't rely on motivation because it's a visitor, not a roommate. Build systems that work even on days you feel terrible. For me that meant removing decisions — same breakfast every day, same workout time, same bedtime. Boring but effective.

**Template 6 — Responding to "I feel alone in this journey":**
> You're not alone, even though it feels that way. Most people around us either don't understand or give unhelpful advice like "just eat less." Finding even one person who checks in with you daily changes everything. Do you have someone who asks you "how did today go?" every evening? That one question is more powerful than any diet plan.

**Template 7 — Responding to food tracking questions:**
> I tried every tracking app and here's the honest truth: the app matters way less than the habit of paying attention to what you eat. Even writing it on a piece of paper works. The magic isn't in the tool — it's in the awareness. That said, if you want simplicity, a photo-based approach (just snap a pic of every meal) works surprisingly well without the calorie-counting stress.

**Template 8 — Responding to "I lost X kg!" celebrations:**
> Amazing work! Can I ask what you think made the biggest difference? I find that people who lose weight successfully always have ONE thing they point to — not a diet, but a habit or a mindset shift. Would love to hear yours because it might help others here.

**Template 9 — Responding to emotional eating posts:**
> Emotional eating isn't a willpower failure — it's your brain using food as the most available coping tool. The fix isn't "stop eating when stressed," it's "find something else that soothes you almost as well." For some people it's a walk, for others it's calling a friend, for me it's literally doing 10 pushups. It interrupts the loop.

**Template 10 — Responding to "which diet is best?":**
> Honest answer? The one you can stick to for 6 months. I've seen people succeed with keto, intermittent fasting, CICO, Mediterranean — the common thread is never the specific diet. It's always: (1) they had a simple system, (2) they had someone checking in on them, and (3) they didn't quit after a bad week. Pick the approach that fits YOUR life and protect your consistency above all else.

---

### Weeks 3-4: Build Authority

**Goal:** Transition from commenter to contributor. Start posting original content. Begin hinting at your accountability work without naming CMM.

**Daily Cadence:**
- 2-3 comments per day (maintain presence)
- 1 original post every 3-4 days (alternate across groups)
- Respond to every reply on your posts within 2 hours

**5 Original Post Ideas:**

**Post 1 — The Accountability Experiment:**
> I've been running a personal experiment for the last month. Every morning, I call a friend and tell them exactly what I plan to eat today. Every evening, I text them what actually happened. No judgment, no advice — just the act of reporting to someone.
>
> Result? I've been more consistent this month than in the previous 6 months combined.
>
> I'm starting to think accountability is the most underrated weight loss tool. Has anyone else tried something like this?

**Post 2 — Why Motivation Fades (And What to Do Instead):**
> I read something that changed how I think about weight loss: "Motivation gets you started. Systems keep you going."
>
> For me, the system that works is stupidly simple — someone checks in on me every day. Not a coach, not a therapist, just someone who asks "did you do what you said you'd do?"
>
> What systems have worked for you? I'm collecting ideas because I'm genuinely fascinated by what makes people stick with it long-term.

**Post 3 — The "Why Do You Quit?" Poll:**
> Genuine question for this group: When you fall off your plan, what's usually the trigger?
>
> A) A stressful event
> B) A social situation (dinner, party)
> C) Boredom / lost motivation
> D) Life got busy and I "forgot"
> E) I didn't see results fast enough
>
> I'm asking because I'm trying to understand what actually breaks consistency — not what diet gurus say, but what real people experience.

**Post 4 — Morning Routines That Actually Work:**
> I asked 20 friends who've lost weight and kept it off: "What's the ONE habit you do every morning?"
>
> The answers surprised me:
> - 12 said they plan their meals for the day (not prep — just plan)
> - 8 said they weigh themselves (not for the number, but for awareness)
> - 6 said they tell someone their intention for the day
> - Only 2 mentioned exercise
>
> The theme? Awareness and accountability beat intensity every time.

**Post 5 — I'm Building Something:**
> Small update for this group, since you've all been so helpful: I've been so fascinated by the power of daily accountability that I started building a tool around it. Nothing fancy yet — just exploring whether technology can replicate the "friend who checks in on you every day" effect.
>
> If anyone has thoughts on what that would look like — what would you want a daily accountability check-in to include? — I'd genuinely love to hear your ideas. You're literally shaping how I think about this.

**Reply Templates When People Ask "How Do You Stay Motivated?":**

> Honestly? I stopped trying to stay motivated. Instead, I set up a system where someone calls me every morning and I tell them my plan for the day. It sounds weird but it works because I hate letting people down more than I hate eating salad. Accountability > motivation, every time.

> I don't stay motivated — nobody does consistently. What I do is make it harder to quit. I tell someone my goal every morning. Now it's not just my goal, it's a promise. Breaking a promise feels worse than skipping a workout.

> The honest answer is I found an accountability partner and it changed everything. We check in daily — takes 5 minutes. On days I don't feel motivated, I still show up because someone is expecting me to. I'm actually exploring how to scale this idea because I think it's the missing piece for most people.

---

### Weeks 5-6: Soft Introduction

**Goal:** Introduce the CMM concept naturally. Position it as something you built for yourself first, then opened up to others. Offer beta access to genuinely interested members.

**How to Naturally Introduce CMM:**

**The "I Built This For Myself" Angle:**

When someone posts about needing accountability, reply:
> This is going to sound self-serving but it's genuinely not — I had the exact same problem and I couldn't find a solution, so I started building one. It's basically an AI that calls you every morning to check in on your goals. I built it for myself first and it's been working better than I expected. If you want to try it, DM me — I'm looking for a few people to test it and give honest feedback. Zero cost, I just need to know if this actually helps people other than me.

**The "Someone Asked Me About This" Angle:**

Post in a group where you're already established:
> A few people DMed me after my post about daily accountability asking what tool I use. Honest answer: I couldn't find one that worked the way I wanted, so I started building one with a friend. It's called Call Me Maybe — it literally calls you on the phone every day to check in on your goals. We're in early testing and looking for beta testers who genuinely want daily accountability. No cost, no obligation — just real feedback from real people. Comment or DM if curious.

**Beta Access Offer Template (for DMs):**
> Hey [name]! Thanks for your interest. Here's what Call Me Maybe does: every morning, you get a phone call from an AI coach. It asks about your plan for the day, checks in on yesterday's goals, and keeps you accountable. Think of it like a personal coach who never judges but never lets you off the hook either.
>
> We're in beta right now (free, obviously) and I'd love your honest feedback. Would you be open to trying it for a week and telling me what works and what doesn't?

**Engagement Rules for Weeks 5-6:**
- Only mention CMM when it's genuinely relevant to the conversation
- Never post CMM as a standalone promotion
- Always frame it as "I built this, want to test it?" not "check out this product"
- Limit CMM mentions to 2-3 per week across all groups
- If someone isn't interested, thank them and move on — never push
- Continue providing value-only comments (at least 60% of your activity should still be pure value)

---

### Weeks 7-8: Conversion

**Goal:** Begin posting about CMM more directly in groups where rules allow. Use testimonials from beta testers. Launch a challenge to drive signups.

**Direct CMM Post (for groups that allow self-promotion or have dedicated promo days):**

> I've been a member of this group for almost 2 months and you've all taught me so much about what actually works for weight loss. I want to share something I've been building:
>
> **Call Me Maybe** — an AI accountability coach that calls you on the phone every day.
>
> Here's how it works:
> - Every morning, you get a phone call
> - The AI checks in: What's your plan today? How did yesterday go?
> - It tracks your consistency and adapts to your goals
> - It never judges — it just keeps showing up
>
> I built it because I realized the #1 predictor of weight loss success isn't the diet — it's having someone who holds you accountable daily.
>
> We have a free tier and we're offering early members a special rate. Happy to answer any questions!
>
> [Link]

**Testimonial-Based Post:**
> One of our beta testers told me this yesterday and I had to share (with permission):
>
> "I've tried every app, every program, every challenge. The difference with Call Me Maybe is that it doesn't let me ghost it. The phone rings every morning and I have to answer — to the AI and to myself. I've been consistent for 3 weeks straight for the first time in years."
>
> This is why I built this. If you want to try it: [Link]

**7-Day Accountability Challenge Launch:**

> **7-DAY ACCOUNTABILITY CHALLENGE — Free, starts Monday**
>
> Here's the deal: for 7 days, you'll get a daily phone call from an AI coach. You tell it your goal for the day. The next morning, it asks how it went. That's it.
>
> No diet plan. No calorie counting. No complicated system. Just someone (well, something) that shows up every single day and asks: "Did you do what you said you'd do?"
>
> I'm running this through Call Me Maybe, the tool I've been building. It's completely free for the challenge.
>
> Rules:
> 1. You pick ONE simple goal (drink 2L water, walk 30min, no snacking after 8pm — keep it simple)
> 2. You answer the daily call (takes 3 minutes)
> 3. You share your experience here at the end of the week
>
> Who's in? Comment "I'M IN" and I'll DM you the signup link.

## 4. Engagement Templates (20 Templates)

### "I Can't Stay Motivated" Threads

**Template 1:**
> What if the problem isn't motivation but isolation? Most people try to lose weight alone and it's brutally hard. Even having one person who texts you "how's today going?" can change everything. The diet matters less than whether someone is watching.

**Template 2:**
> Motivation is overrated — and I mean that in the most supportive way possible. The people I know who've kept weight off don't feel motivated most days. They have systems: meal prep Sunday, same breakfast daily, someone they check in with. Build the system for the days when motivation disappears (which is most days).

### "I Keep Falling Off the Wagon" Threads

**Template 3:**
> The wagon metaphor is the problem. There's no wagon. There's just today. You ate pizza yesterday? Cool, that was yesterday. What are you eating for lunch TODAY? The people who succeed aren't the ones who never fall off — they're the ones who make "getting back on" take hours instead of weeks.

**Template 4:**
> Can I ask something honest? When you "fall off," is anyone in your life noticing? Because most of us fall off in silence. We stop tracking, stop posting, stop telling anyone. If you had someone who noticed within 24 hours that you went quiet — would that change things?

### "Nothing Works for Me" Threads

**Template 5:**
> I used to say this too. Then I realized: lots of things "worked" — I just didn't stick with any of them long enough. The problem was never the plan. It was that nobody was holding me to the plan past day 14. What if the missing ingredient isn't a better diet but a better accountability system?

**Template 6:**
> When someone says "nothing works," I always ask: "For how long did you try?" Not to judge — genuinely. Because most approaches work if you do them for 90 days. The real question is: what would help you get through 90 days without quitting?

### "How Do You Track Food?" Threads

**Template 7:**
> I've tried MyFitnessPal, Yazio, Noom, paper journals — honestly the method matters less than the consistency of doing it. My current approach is dead simple: I tell someone what I'm planning to eat in the morning, and I report back at night. The social pressure of "someone knows my plan" works better for me than any app.

**Template 8:**
> Hot take: stop tracking calories and start tracking consistency. Did you eat roughly what you planned? Yes/no. Did you stop when you were full? Yes/no. Did you drink enough water? Yes/no. Three binary questions beat a 45-minute food logging session every time.

### "Morning Routine" Threads

**Template 9:**
> My morning routine for weight loss has exactly 3 steps: (1) Weigh myself — not for the number, for the awareness. (2) Drink 500ml water. (3) Decide what I'm eating today and tell someone. Total time: 4 minutes. I've tried elaborate routines with journaling and meditation and cold showers. I always quit those. This one stuck because it's boring enough to be sustainable.

**Template 10:**
> The best morning routine is the one you actually do on a Tuesday when you're tired and running late. If your routine requires 45 minutes and perfect conditions, it's a hobby, not a routine. My non-negotiable is one thing: I communicate my intention for the day to someone. Takes 2 minutes. Everything else is bonus.

### "Accountability Partner Wanted" Threads (GOLDMINE)

**Template 11:**
> I've done the accountability partner thing and here's what I learned: it works amazingly for 2-3 weeks, then one person gets busy, stops responding, and the whole thing collapses. The fix? You need a partner who literally can't ghost you. Someone (or something) that calls YOU, not the other way around. I've been experimenting with this idea and I'm happy to share what's working for me if you're interested.

**Template 12:**
> Accountability partners are the single most effective weight loss tool I've found — and also the hardest to maintain. The human version is fragile (people get busy, feel awkward, stop responding). I've been thinking a lot about how to make accountability consistent and automatic. Would love to chat about this if you're serious about finding a solution.

### "Before/After" Celebration Threads

**Template 13:**
> Incredible transformation! Can I ask a question that might help others here: what was the #1 thing that kept you going during the middle part? Not the exciting beginning, not the rewarding end — but weeks 4-12 when motivation was gone and results were slow. That's where most people quit and I think your answer could genuinely help someone.

**Template 14:**
> This is amazing, congratulations! I'm always curious: did you have someone holding you accountable? A friend, a coach, a partner? Every success story I've heard has an accountability element somewhere, and I think it's the most underrated factor in weight loss.

### "Plateau" Frustration Threads

**Template 15:**
> Plateaus are where 80% of people quit, so the fact that you're here posting about it instead of silently giving up means you're already in the top 20%. Two practical things: (1) are you sleeping 7+ hours? Sleep deprivation causes cortisol spikes that block fat loss. (2) Are you telling anyone about this frustration? Suffering in silence makes plateaus feel permanent. Talking about it helps you push through.

**Template 16:**
> Plateaus test your systems, not your willpower. If your system is "I feel motivated so I eat well," a plateau will destroy you. If your system is "someone checks in on me every day regardless of results," you survive the plateau and come out the other side. What does your current system look like?

### "Diet Culture Is Toxic" Threads

**Template 17:**
> 100% agree. The diet industry profits from your failure — they WANT you to try, fail, and buy the next thing. What I've found actually works has nothing to do with a specific diet: it's having someone in your corner every single day who asks "how are you doing?" without judgment. No product, no plan, no restriction — just human connection and accountability.

**Template 18:**
> This is such an important conversation. I think the antidote to toxic diet culture is removing the shame and adding support. Instead of "I'm bad because I ate cake," it becomes "I ate cake, here's why, here's what I'll do differently tomorrow." That reframe requires someone to talk to — someone who won't judge. Accountability without shame is the goal.

### "What App Do You Use?" Threads

**Template 19:**
> I've tried most of them. MyFitnessPal is great for tracking, Noom is good for psychology, but honestly the thing that moved the needle most for me wasn't an app — it was having daily check-ins with a real accountability system. I actually started looking into tools that call you on the phone to check in because I realized I ignore app notifications but I always answer a phone call.

**Template 20:**
> Unpopular opinion: the app doesn't matter. I've watched people succeed with free apps and fail with expensive coaches. The variable that predicts success isn't the tool — it's whether someone is paying attention to your progress. Notifications are easy to swipe away. A voice asking "how did today go?" is not. That's the insight that changed everything for me.

## 5. Rules and Safety

### What NOT to Do

1. **Never use a fake profile.** Admins check. Members check. One screenshot of a fake profile gets posted and your reputation is destroyed across every French weight loss group.

2. **Never post promotional content in groups that prohibit it.** Read the group rules on day one. Screenshot them. Many groups have specific promo days (e.g., "Vendredi promo"). Only post about CMM on those days in those groups.

3. **Never spam the same comment across multiple groups.** Facebook's algorithm detects copy-paste behavior and will restrict your account. Write variations of your templates, not carbon copies.

4. **Never DM people first without an invitation.** Unsolicited DMs are the fastest way to get reported. Only DM people who comment on YOUR posts or explicitly ask for more information.

5. **Never be negative about other products or approaches.** If someone loves WW or Noom, support them. "Whatever works for you!" is always the right response. CMM is an addition, not a replacement.

6. **Never fake testimonials.** Every testimonial must be from a real user with their permission. One fake testimonial discovered destroys all trust permanently.

7. **Never post more than once per day in any single group.** Comments are unlimited (within reason). Original posts should be spaced 3-4 days apart per group.

8. **Never argue with group members.** If someone disagrees with you, thank them for their perspective and move on. Arguments make you look defensive and hurt your authority.

### How to Handle Admin Warnings

**If an admin sends you a warning about promotional content:**
1. Respond immediately and politely
2. Apologize genuinely: "You're right, I apologize. I got excited about sharing and crossed the line. It won't happen again."
3. Ask what's allowed: "I want to stay in this group because I genuinely learn from the community. Can you tell me the rules around sharing tools or resources so I stay within bounds?"
4. Follow their rules exactly going forward
5. Go back to pure value mode for at least 2 weeks before mentioning CMM again

**If an admin removes your post:**
- Do NOT repost it
- Do NOT DM the admin to argue
- Continue engaging with value-only comments as if nothing happened
- You can DM the admin a week later to ask for clarification on rules, but only if you do it respectfully

**If you get banned from a group:**
- Accept it and move on
- Do not create a second account to rejoin
- Focus your energy on the other 9 groups
- Learn from what got you banned and don't repeat it

### When to Leave a Group

Leave a group if:
- It has fewer than 3 posts per day (dead community, not worth your time)
- The admin is hostile to any external resource sharing (you'll never be able to mention CMM)
- The group is overwhelmingly negative and members attack each other
- You've been there 4+ weeks and none of your comments get engagement (wrong audience)
- The group has become primarily a marketplace for MLM products

### General Safety Practices

- **Screenshot everything.** Keep records of admin conversations, your posts, and positive responses. This is both for legal protection and for tracking what works.
- **Alternate activity across groups.** Don't be ultra-active in one group and silent in others. Spread your engagement evenly.
- **Take breaks.** If you're getting burned out on community engagement, take 2-3 days off. Consistency matters more than intensity.
- **Monitor your account health.** If Facebook restricts your commenting ability, you've been too aggressive. Pull back immediately.
- **Separate personal and professional.** Your Facebook profile will become semi-public through this strategy. Make sure your personal posts and photos reflect well on you.
