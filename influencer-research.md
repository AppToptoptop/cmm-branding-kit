## Outreach Strategy

### Step 1: Build the Pipeline

1. **Start with nano/micro tier** -- they are 6.7x more cost-effective and generate 60% higher engagement rates than larger influencers.
2. **Prioritize influencers who already discuss**: accountability, habits, daily routines, transformation journeys, coaching.
3. **Use platforms**: Modash, Heepsy, HypeAuditor, or Click Analytic to verify audience demographics (France, women 25-40).

### Step 2: Personalized Outreach

**DM Template (Instagram/TikTok):**

> Salut [Prenom]! Je suis Aaron, co-fondateur de Call Me Maybe, une app d'IA qui appelle les gens chaque jour pour les aider a tenir leurs objectifs fitness/perte de poids. Ton contenu sur [specific topic they cover] m'a vraiment parle -- on partage la meme vision: la regularite bat la motivation.
>
> J'aimerais t'offrir un acces gratuit pour tester l'app et, si ca te plait, explorer un partenariat. Pas de pression, juste un outil qui pourrait aussi aider ta communaute.
>
> Ca te dit d'en discuter? :)

**Key Outreach Principles:**
- Reference specific content they created (never generic)
- Lead with value (free access, not "promote us")
- 70% of brands now prefer nano/micro partnerships -- position this as an early-stage opportunity
- Follow up once after 5-7 days, then move on
- Engage with their content for 1-2 weeks before DMing

### Step 3: Campaign Structure

| Phase | Timeline | Action | Budget |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Phase 1: Seeding** | Weeks 1-4 | Gift free CMM access to 15-20 nano/micro influencers | 0 EUR (product only) |
| **Phase 2: Paid micro** | Weeks 4-8 | Sponsor 5-8 micro influencers for honest review content | 3,000-8,000 EUR |
| **Phase 3: Mid-tier push** | Weeks 8-12 | Partner with 2-3 mid-tier creators for multi-post campaigns | 8,000-15,000 EUR |
| **Phase 4: Macro launch** | Month 4+ | Secure 1 macro/ambassador for launch visibility | 10,000-30,000 EUR |

### Step 4: Content Brief for Influencers

**Suggested formats:**
1. **"My morning routine with CMM"** -- show the phone call, reaction, accountability moment
2. **"7-day CMM challenge"** -- document daily calls and progress over a week
3. **"Why I finally stuck to my goals"** -- testimonial format, authentic storytelling
4. **"Phone call reaction"** -- film yourself receiving the AI coaching call (viral potential)
5. **"Before/After with CMM"** -- 30-day transformation with daily accountability

## Priority Targets

### Tier 1: Immediate Outreach (Highest ROI, Best Fit)

These influencers match CMM's target audience, value proposition, and budget perfectly.

| Priority | Influencer | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | **La Mini Coach TDAH** (Alice, 148K IG) | ADHD = accountability struggles. CMM solves this directly. Educated audience. Mid-tier pricing. |
| 2 | **Ysaline Benakli** (338K TikTok) | Dietitian credibility. "Love Your Body" program philosophy matches CMM. |
| 3 | **Marine NutriFit** (48.7K IG) | Micro tier, nutrition-focused weight loss. Affordable, engaged audience. |
| 4 | **Richard Mzg** (196K IG) | Sustainable habits messaging. Simplifies nutrition. Male audience for secondary CMM target. |
| 5 | **Remi Ragnar** (300K YT, 100K IG) | "Big brother" supportive tone mirrors CMM coach personality. Beginner-friendly. |
| 6 | **Marie Fiiit** (28.1K IG) | True micro, high engagement. Low cost test campaign. |
| 7 | **From Colmar to the Moon** (20.1K IG) | Personal transformation story. Authentic testimonial potential. |
| 8 | **Kenya Scandella** (17.7K IG) | Micro with strong engagement. Perfect for initial seeding. |

### Tier 2: Secondary Outreach (Strong Fit, Higher Budget)

| Priority | Influencer | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| 9 | **Lucile Woodward** (298K IG) | Holistic coach (sport + nutrition + mental). Professional credibility. |
| 10 | **Alaia Hennequin** (342K IG) | Founded Elevate app -- understands fitness tech. Body positivity. |
| 11 | **Julie Ferrat** (895K TikTok) | Transformation + self-acceptance story. Large TikTok reach. |
| 12 | **Oceane Andrea** (4M+ IG reach) | Podcast "Chez Nous" = dual channel exposure. Authenticity. |
| 13 | **Nicolas Fleck** (283K IG) | Young male fitness audience. Motivational content. |

### Tier 3: Aspirational / Launch Phase

| Priority | Influencer | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| 14 | **Sissy Mua** (3.5M+ total) | TrainSweatEat app founder. Understands fitness-tech. Expensive but massive. |
| 15 | **Major Mouvement** (1M IG, 1.2M YT) | Health professional credibility. Humor-based approach. |
| 16 | **Karoline.Ro** (417K IG, 451K TikTok) | BestStrong app founder. Fitness-tech crossover. |

### Nano Seeding Batch (Product + Perks, No Cash)

Send free CMM access **+ a Presto Fresco pizza voucher** to these nano influencers with no obligation. The pizza offer costs ~5-8 EUR per influencer (partner deal) and makes the outreach feel generous and personal -- not transactional. If they love the app, they will post organically. The pizza creates a "moment" worth filming (unboxing + tasting = content).

**Why pizza works:**
- A free app subscription feels intangible; a free pizza feels *real*
- Creates a shareable moment ("I got a free pizza for trying this app")
- Aligns with weight loss narrative when framed as "your cheat day, earned"
- Presto Fresco gets tagged in the content = free exposure for them too
- Cost per influencer: ~5-8 EUR (vs. 50-200 EUR for a paid nano post)

| Influencer | Followers | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| @jonath_reyzs_fit | 6.8K | Nano fitness |
| @yo.ferreira_ | 5.2K | Nano fitness lifestyle |
| @fromcolmartothemoon | 20.1K | Micro transformation |
| @kenyascandella | 17.7K | Micro fitness |
| @mariefiiit | 28.1K | Micro fitness |
| @c.saskie | 31.8K | Micro fitness/nutrition |
| Cerveau TDAH (Camille) | Growing | ADHD niche |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with ADHD niche**: La Mini Coach TDAH is the single highest-priority partner. Her audience literally struggles with accountability -- CMM is the solution. This is a blue ocean positioning that no competitor occupies.

2. **Nano/micro first**: 70% of brands in 2025 prefer nano/micro partnerships. They deliver 60% higher engagement and are 6.7x more cost-effective. Seed 10-15 nano influencers with free access before spending any cash.

3. **Podcast is underrated**: Change ma vie (40M+ listens) and Chez Nous (2.5M+ downloads) reach exactly CMM's target. A mid-roll host-read costs 500-2,000 EUR but reaches highly engaged, habits-focused listeners.

4. **Fitness-tech founders are gold**: Karoline.Ro (BestStrong), Alaia Hennequin (Elevate), Sissy Mua (TrainSweatEat), and Justine Gallice (Fiit Fight Forever) all built fitness apps. They understand the value of digital tools and their audiences already pay for fitness apps.

5. **Content format matters**: "Phone call reaction" videos have the highest viral potential on TikTok. Have influencers film themselves receiving the CMM coaching call -- the surprise/emotional element drives shares.

6. **Budget recommendation**: Start with 3,000-5,000 EUR for a Phase 1 micro campaign (5-8 influencers + product seeding). Scale to 15,000-25,000 EUR for Phase 2-3 if initial results are strong.

7. **Perks Program = zero-cost nano strategy**: Instead of paying nano influencers cash, offer them partner perks (Presto Fresco pizza, gym day passes, healthy meal kits). This costs 5-10 EUR per influencer via partner deals, creates shareable moments, and builds the CMM Perks ecosystem. Partners benefit from free exposure + SEO backlinks on CMM's partner page.

---

## CMM Perks Program — Partner Influencer Strategy

### The Concept

Instead of cash compensation for nano influencers, CMM builds a **Perks ecosystem** with local partners (restaurants, gyms, wellness brands). Each nano influencer receives:

1. Free CMM app access (3-month trial)
2. A **partner perk** (e.g. Presto Fresco pizza, gym day pass, smoothie box)
3. No posting obligation — but the perk creates a natural content moment

### Why Partners Join

| Benefit for Partner | Detail |
|-------------------|--------|
| **SEO backlink** | Listed on CMM's partner page with dofollow link — improves their Google ranking |
| **Community exposure** | CMM users see their brand as a "reward" for hitting goals |
| **Influencer tags** | Nano influencers tag the partner in their content = free exposure |
| **Health-positive association** | Being part of a wellness community improves brand perception |
| **Zero cash cost** | Partners only give product/discounts — no advertising fees |

### Launch Partners (Proposed)

| Partner | Perk Offered | Cost to CMM | Content Moment |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Presto Fresco** | 1 free pizza | ~5-8 EUR (partner price) | "I earned my cheat day pizza with CMM" |
| Local gym (Basic-Fit, etc.) | 1-day guest pass | Free (gyms give these away) | "Morning workout after my CMM call" |
| Healthy meal delivery | Trial box | ~10-15 EUR | Unboxing + "my CMM-approved meal prep" |
| Smoothie bar | Free smoothie | ~3-5 EUR | "Post-workout fuel, courtesy of CMM" |

### ROI Math

- 15 nano influencers × 8 EUR avg perk = **120 EUR total**
- vs. 15 nano influencers × 100 EUR cash = **1,500 EUR**
- **Savings: 1,380 EUR (92% cheaper)**
- Plus: partners get free marketing, CMM builds ecosystem
