## Day-by-Day Calendar

---

### DAY 1 -- Monday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** STORY
**Language:** [FR] -- Film in French

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"J'ai construit une IA qui t'appelle tous les matins pour te faire maigrir."
(English: "I built an AI that calls you every morning to make you lose weight.")

**Full Script (80 words):**
Open with founder facing camera, casual energy. "I'm a tech founder and I just built something kind of insane. An AI that calls you on your phone -- every single morning -- to check if you stuck to your plan. No app to open. No notifications to ignore. An actual phone call. You pick up, you talk to your AI coach, and it holds you accountable. It works because you can't swipe away a ringing phone. Link in bio if you want to try it."

**Visual Direction:**
Founder sitting at desk with laptop open showing code/app mockup. Camera slightly below eye level. Quick cuts between talking head and B-roll of phone ringing. End with phone screen showing incoming call from "Your AI Coach."

**Hashtags:**
`#AIcoach #pertedepoids #startuplife #buildinpublic #coachingminceur #pourtoi #techstartup #motivation`

**Posting Time:** 12:30 PM (Paris time -- lunch break scroll)

**Notes:**
- This is THE anchor video. Pin it to profile.
- Use trending "storytelling" audio underneath at low volume (check TikTok trending sounds day-of).
- A/B test: film a second version with the English hook "I built an AI that calls you every morning" for broader reach.
- Reply to every comment within the first 30 minutes. Pin the best question as top comment.

---

### DAY 2 -- Tuesday
**Platform:** Instagram Carousel Post + Stories
**Pillar:** EDUCATE
**Language:** [FR] -- French captions

**Hook (first slide / first line):**
"95% des regimes echouent. Voici pourquoi." (English: "95% of diets fail. Here's why.")

**Full Script / Post Description (90 words):**
5-slide carousel post. Slide 1: Bold stat "95% of diets fail within 5 years." Slide 2: "The problem isn't willpower. It's isolation." Slide 3: "Studies show that daily accountability check-ins increase success rates by 65%." Slide 4: "That's why we built an AI that calls you every day. Not a notification. Not an app. A real phone call." Slide 5: "Join the waitlist -- your first week is free." Include source citations on slides for credibility (UCLA meta-analysis, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology).

**Visual Direction:**
Clean, dark-mode carousel design matching CMM brand (dark background, gold/teal accents, Sora font). Each slide has one key stat with a supporting visual -- graph, icon, or illustration. Final slide has waitlist CTA with QR code.

**Hashtags:**
`#pertedepoids #regime #nutrition #bienetre #motivation #sciencedelaminceur #coachIA #objectifminceur`

**Posting Time:** 7:30 AM (Paris time -- morning routine scroll)

**Notes:**
- Share each slide as individual stories with poll stickers: "Did you know this?" YES/NO
- Save carousel to "Highlights" under a "Science" category
- This post type gets saved/shared more than videos -- optimize for that
- Boost with 10-20 EUR if organic reach exceeds 5K in first 24h

---

### DAY 3 -- Wednesday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** HOOK
**Language:** [FR] -- French with English captions option

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"POV: Ton telephone sonne a 7h du matin et c'est ton coach IA."
(English: "POV: Your phone rings at 7am and it's your AI coach.")

**Full Script (70 words):**
Film as POV. Alarm goes off. Hand reaches for phone. Screen shows incoming call: "Your AI Coach - Call Me Maybe." Pick up. AI voice (use text-to-speech or pre-recorded): "Good morning! Yesterday you said you'd skip the croissant. Did you?" Pause. Guilty face. Cut to text on screen: "The accountability you didn't know you needed." End card with waitlist link.

**Visual Direction:**
Film in bedroom, morning light (or fake it with warm lamp). Start with close-up of phone on nightstand buzzing. POV camera angle -- viewer sees what the person sees. Show the phone screen with the incoming call UI. Use split-screen or reaction cam in corner. Keep it under 30 seconds for maximum completion rate.

**Hashtags:**
`#POV #pourtoi #routinematinale #AIcoach #pertedepoids #motivation #coachingminceur #fyp`

**Posting Time:** 7:00 PM (Paris time -- evening prime time)

**Notes:**
- Use the "Oh No" trending sound or a dramatic wake-up sound effect
- The croissant detail makes it specifically French and relatable -- lean into cultural references
- This format is highly duettable -- encourage viewers to duet with their reaction
- A/B test: try "POV: It's 6am and your AI coach is already calling" as alternate hook

---

### DAY 4 -- Thursday
**Platform:** Instagram Stories (series of 5-7 stories) + TikTok
**Pillar:** STORY
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first story frame):**
"Pourquoi j'ai quitte mon job pour construire une IA qui appelle les gens."
(English: "Why I quit my job to build an AI that calls people.")

**Full Script (90 words):**
Story 1: Text overlay on founder selfie: "Story time: Why I built Call Me Maybe." Story 2: "I tried every diet app. MyFitnessPal. Noom. Yazio. They all have the same problem." Story 3: "You can ignore a notification. You can't ignore a phone call." Story 4: "So I built an AI that literally calls you every morning." Story 5: "It asks you what you ate, what you're planning, and holds you accountable." Story 6: Poll sticker: "Would you answer a daily AI call? YES / MAYBE." Story 7: "Link in bio to join the waitlist."

**Visual Direction:**
Raw, unfiltered stories. Founder talking directly to camera with no ring light -- just phone selfie mode. This should feel authentic and spontaneous, not produced. Add text overlays with the key phrases. Use Instagram story features: polls, questions, countdown timer to launch.

**Hashtags:** N/A (stories don't use hashtags -- use location tag "Paris, France" and mention sticker @callmemaybe)

**Posting Time:** 8:00 AM (Paris time) + re-share at 6:00 PM

**Notes:**
- Add a countdown sticker for the launch date
- Use the Question Box: "What's YOUR biggest struggle with dieting?" -- collect answers for future content
- Save to Highlights under "Our Story"
- This builds parasocial connection -- be vulnerable and real

---

### DAY 5 -- Friday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** HOOK
**Language:** [EN] -- English (for broader viral potential, add French subtitles)

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"My AI coach is more consistent than my gym buddy."

**Full Script (75 words):**
Split screen or text-based comparison. Left side: "Your gym buddy" -- texts "can't make it today," cancels last minute, sleeps in, forgets your goals. Right side: "Your AI coach" -- calls at 7am sharp, remembers your meal plan, never cancels, tracks your progress, no judgment. Punchline: "And it costs less than one session with a personal trainer." End with CTA: "Link in bio."

**Visual Direction:**
Use the popular split-screen or "expectation vs reality" format. Left side filmed sloppily (simulating the unreliable friend) with chaotic energy. Right side filmed cleanly with the phone showing the AI call interface. Can also do this as a greenscreen with screenshots. Keep it punchy -- 20-25 seconds max.

**Hashtags:**
`#gymbuddy #accountability #AIcoach #pertedepoids #fitnessmotivation #pourtoi #humour #relatable`

**Posting Time:** 12:00 PM (Paris time -- Friday lunch)

**Notes:**
- This is designed for shares and tags -- people will tag their unreliable gym buddy
- Add text: "Tag your gym buddy who NEEDS this" as pinned comment
- Use a trending "comparison" sound
- Potential for very high engagement through tags

---

### DAY 6 -- Saturday
**Platform:** Instagram Post (single image or short Reel) + TikTok
**Pillar:** EDUCATE
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first line / image text):**
"Les Francaises ne font pas de regime. Elles ont un systeme."
(English: "French women don't diet. They have a system.")

**Full Script (85 words):**
Open with the cultural insight. "There's a reason French women are known for staying slim without crazy diets. It's not genetics. It's not magic. It's accountability and structure. Small portions. Daily rituals. Someone to answer to. That's exactly what Call Me Maybe does -- except your 'someone' is an AI that calls you every single morning. No judgment. No guilt. Just a daily check-in that keeps you honest. The French approach to weight loss, powered by AI."

**Visual Direction:**
For Instagram: elegant, editorial-style image. Dark background with gold text overlay. Could use a flat lay of a French breakfast (coffee, fruit, small pastry) with the phone showing an incoming AI call. For TikTok: talking head with B-roll of Parisian cafe scenes, morning coffee rituals, elegant food presentation. Lean into the "French lifestyle" aesthetic.

**Hashtags:**
`#frenchwomen #artdevivre #bienetre #lifestyle #pertedepoids #coachIA #habitudesaines #elegance`

**Posting Time:** 10:00 AM (Paris time -- Saturday morning relaxed scroll)

**Notes:**
- This taps into the "French girl" aesthetic that performs extremely well on both platforms
- Do NOT make it feel diet-culture-y -- frame it as lifestyle and elegance
- Could go viral in both French and international markets
- A/B test: "The French secret to staying slim isn't what you think" as alternate hook

---

### DAY 7 -- Sunday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** SOCIAL PROOF
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"Jour 1: une IA m'appelle tous les matins pour mon regime."
(English: "Day 1 of getting called by an AI coach every morning.")

**Full Script (80 words):**
This starts the POV series. Film as a daily vlog style. "OK so I signed up for this app that calls me every morning to check on my weight loss. Day 1. The phone rings at 7:15. I almost didn't pick up. But the AI actually asked me what I had for breakfast and what my plan is for the day. It felt... weirdly motivating? Like someone actually cares. Let's see how day 2 goes. Follow for updates."

**Visual Direction:**
Authentic vlog style -- slightly messy bedroom, natural morning light, no makeup, real reaction. Film the actual phone ringing (use the app interface or mock it). Show genuine surprise/amusement at the AI interaction. End with a "to be continued" text overlay. This should feel like a real person documenting their experience, not a polished ad.

**Hashtags:**
`#jour1 #challenge #AIcoach #pertedepoids #routinematinale #vlog #accountability #pourtoi`

**Posting Time:** 6:00 PM (Paris time -- Sunday evening, high engagement window)

**Notes:**
- This kicks off a SERIES -- the algorithm rewards series content
- Ask in comments: "Should I keep going? Day 2 tomorrow?"
- Pin a comment: "Follow pour la suite!" ("Follow for the rest!")
- This can be filmed by the founder or a beta tester
- Plan to film days 1, 3, 5, 7 of the series across the month (not every day -- keep anticipation)

---

### DAY 8 -- Monday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** HOOK
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"Qu'est-ce qui se passe quand tu ne reponds PAS a ton coach IA?"
(English: "What happens when you DON'T answer your accountability call?")

**Full Script (85 words):**
Build suspense. "So here's the thing about Call Me Maybe. If you don't pick up... it calls again. And if you still don't pick up... it sends you a message. And then it calls AGAIN in the evening. You literally cannot ghost your AI coach. And that's the point. Because how many times have you told yourself 'I'll start tomorrow' and then... didn't? Your AI coach doesn't accept 'tomorrow.' It only accepts TODAY." End with text: "Join the waitlist."

**Visual Direction:**
Quick-cut montage: phone ringing (ignored), phone ringing again (person groaning), text notification popping up, phone ringing a third time, person finally answering with a defeated "fine." Use dramatic music that builds tension. Can add a comedic twist at the end -- the AI voice says something encouraging like "I knew you'd pick up. Let's crush today."

**Hashtags:**
`#accountability #noexcuses #AIcoach #pertedepoids #motivation #discipline #coachingminceur #pourtoi`

**Posting Time:** 7:30 PM (Paris time -- Monday evening)

**Notes:**
- This addresses a real feature differentiator -- persistence
- Use the "Stranger Things" suspense sound or similar trending dramatic audio
- The humor of being "stalked" by an AI coach is inherently shareable
- Comment prompt: "Would you pick up or ghost the AI?"

---

### DAY 9 -- Tuesday
**Platform:** Instagram Carousel + Stories
**Pillar:** EDUCATE
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first slide):**
"Le secret de Duolingo que personne n'applique a la perte de poids."
(English: "The secret Duolingo doesn't want you to know about weight loss.")

**Full Script (95 words):**
6-slide carousel. Slide 1: Hook text with Duolingo owl icon. Slide 2: "Duolingo's success isn't the lessons. It's the STREAKS." Slide 3: "Streaks create daily habits. Daily habits create results. That's behavioral psychology 101." Slide 4: "Now imagine Duolingo but for weight loss. Instead of a passive notification you can ignore, you get a PHONE CALL." Slide 5: "Call Me Maybe uses streak psychology + daily phone calls to make weight loss as addictive as learning Spanish." Slide 6: CTA with streak counter visual: "Start your streak. Link in bio."

**Visual Direction:**
Design with the green Duolingo color palette on slide 1-2 transitioning to CMM's dark/gold palette on slides 3-6. Use streak counter visuals, fire emojis, progress bars. Make the comparison visual and intuitive. Include a mockup of the CMM streak feature. Final slide should have a strong visual CTA.

**Hashtags:**
`#duolingo #streaks #habitudes #gamification #pertedepoids #motivation #coachIA #psychologie`

**Posting Time:** 12:15 PM (Paris time -- lunch break)

**Notes:**
- Duolingo comparisons perform extremely well because everyone knows the app
- This positions CMM's gamification angle clearly
- Share in stories with a quiz: "How long is your longest Duolingo streak?" followed by "Now imagine that streak... but for weight loss"
- Tag @duolingo (they sometimes engage with comparisons -- free exposure)

---

### DAY 10 -- Wednesday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** HOOK
**Language:** [EN] -- English (broader reach), French subtitles

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"I deleted MyFitnessPal for this."

**Full Script (75 words):**
Film with phone in hand showing MyFitnessPal being deleted. "I've been using MyFitnessPal for 3 years. Logging calories. Scanning barcodes. And you know what? I still gained weight. Because logging food doesn't create accountability. Phone calls do. So I deleted MFP and switched to an AI that calls me every morning. No logging. No scanning. Just a conversation. And honestly? It works better." Show the AI call interface. "Link in bio."

**Visual Direction:**
Start extreme close-up on phone screen showing the "Delete MyFitnessPal?" confirmation popup. Dramatic pause. Tap delete. Cut to face -- confident expression. Then show the CMM interface / incoming call. Split screen at the end: left = MFP calorie logging (tedious), right = quick phone call (easy). Keep it under 30 seconds.

**Hashtags:**
`#myfitnesspal #caloriecounting #dietapp #AIcoach #weightloss #pertedepoids #appcomparison #fyp`

**Posting Time:** 7:00 PM (Paris time)

**Notes:**
- Controversial take -- will generate debate in comments (good for engagement)
- Prepare for pushback from MFP fans -- have thoughtful replies ready
- Pin comment: "Not saying MFP is bad -- I'm saying accountability > logging"
- A/B test: "I tracked calories for 3 years and gained weight. Here's what actually works."
- High save/share potential for people frustrated with calorie counting

---

### DAY 11 -- Thursday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** STORY
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"Jour 3: mon coach IA m'a grille sur le croissant."
(English: "Day 3: My AI coach caught me about the croissant.")

**Full Script (80 words):**
Continue the POV series. "Day 3 update of the AI coach calls. So this morning it asked me what I had for breakfast. I said 'yogurt and fruit.' Then it said 'and what about the croissant you mentioned yesterday you were going to avoid?' THIS THING REMEMBERS EVERYTHING. I felt so called out. But honestly? That's exactly what I need. Someone -- or something -- that doesn't let me lie to myself. Day 5 coming soon."

**Visual Direction:**
Same vlog format as Day 7. Morning setting, casual, authentic. Show a real croissant on the table (visual comedy). React genuinely to the AI "catching" the lie. Use a zoom-in on the face when "caught." This should feel like a diary entry -- intimate and honest. Add text overlay: "Day 3/30."

**Hashtags:**
`#jour3 #challenge30jours #croissant #AIcoach #pertedepoids #accountability #vlog #pourtoi`

**Posting Time:** 12:30 PM (Paris time)

**Notes:**
- The croissant detail is GOLD for French audience -- ultra-relatable
- This episode should feel funnier than Day 1 -- the AI is becoming a character
- Comment prompt: "What food would YOUR AI coach call you out on?"
- High engagement potential from food-related discussions

---

### DAY 12 -- Friday
**Platform:** Instagram Post (Meme / Relatable graphic) + Stories
**Pillar:** HOOK
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (image text):**
"Moi: 'Je commence lundi.' Mon coach IA: 'On est lundi. Je t'appelle.'"
(English: "Me: 'I'll start Monday.' My AI coach: 'It IS Monday. I'm calling you.'")

**Full Script / Post Description (60 words):**
Single image meme post. Dark background, white/gold text. The humor is in the AI taking your excuses literally. Caption: "Your AI coach takes you at your word. Every. Single. Time. No more 'I'll start next week.' Comment the excuse your AI coach would destroy."

**Visual Direction:**
Clean meme format on brand colors (dark bg, gold text, CMM logo watermark). Can use a split image: left = person on couch looking guilty, right = phone ringing with "AI Coach" on screen. Or simple text-on-dark-background format that's easy to screenshot and share.

**Hashtags:**
`#meme #humour #pertedepoids #motivation #lundi #excuses #coachIA #relatable`

**Posting Time:** 6:00 PM (Paris time -- Friday evening humor)

**Notes:**
- Memes get shared in DMs -- this is a word-of-mouth driver
- Save it to a "Memes" highlight on Instagram
- Create 2-3 similar memes and test which format works best
- Encourage screenshots by making the design clean and shareable

---

### DAY 13 -- Saturday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** EDUCATE
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"Cette appli a remplace ma nutritionniste a 200 euros par mois."
(English: "This app replaced my 200 EUR/month nutritionist.")

**Full Script (85 words):**
"Before you come at me -- I love nutritionists. They changed my life. But let's be honest: 200 euros a month? For most people that's not sustainable. What if you could get 80% of the accountability for 10% of the price? That's Call Me Maybe. A daily phone call with an AI that knows your goals, your meal plan, and your weak spots. It's not replacing medical advice. It's replacing the part where someone checks on you every day."

**Visual Direction:**
Start with a shot of a calculator showing "200 EUR x 12 = 2,400 EUR/year." Then transition to the CMM pricing (use a mockup showing a much lower number). Talking head throughout, genuine and respectful tone -- not dismissive of nutritionists. Show testimonial-style framing. End with side-by-side comparison chart: Nutritionist vs AI Coach (frequency, cost, availability).

**Hashtags:**
`#nutritionniste #pertedepoids #coaching #budget #bienetre #coachIA #sante #economiser`

**Posting Time:** 10:30 AM (Paris time -- Saturday morning)

**Notes:**
- This will be controversial -- nutritionists may push back
- Be VERY clear: "This doesn't replace medical advice, it replaces daily accountability"
- Pin comment with this clarification
- High save rate -- people will save this for the comparison
- A/B test: "How I get daily coaching for less than a Netflix subscription"

---

### DAY 14 -- Sunday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel + Instagram Story recap
**Pillar:** SOCIAL PROOF
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"Reagir a mon appel avec mon coach IA (c'est intense)."
(English: "Reacting to my AI coach call. It's intense.")

**Full Script (80 words):**
Film an actual (or simulated) call with the AI coach. Show the phone ringing, picking up, putting on speaker. The AI asks questions about yesterday's meals, today's plan, and gives encouragement. Film your genuine reactions -- surprise when it remembers details, laughing at its directness, nodding when it gives good advice. "This is what it's actually like. Every single morning. It's like having a best friend who only talks about your goals."

**Visual Direction:**
Split screen: top half is the phone screen showing the call in progress, bottom half is the face cam showing reactions. Or film reaction-style with the phone audio playing through speaker. Raw and unedited feel. Show timestamps to prove it's a real morning. Natural lighting, bedhead, authenticity is key. This is a "react" format video -- a proven viral format.

**Hashtags:**
`#react #AIcoach #coachingIA #pertedepoids #reaction #appeldumatin #pourtoi #viral`

**Posting Time:** 5:00 PM (Paris time -- Sunday afternoon)

**Notes:**
- React videos are among the highest-performing formats on TikTok
- If the actual AI isn't ready, simulate with a pre-recorded script and act naturally
- End with: "Want to try it? Link in bio"
- Story recap: Post "Week 2 Recap" story with best stats from the week

---

### DAY 15 -- Monday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** CTA
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"On ouvre 100 places pour tester Call Me Maybe. Gratuitement."
(English: "We're opening 100 spots to test Call Me Maybe. For free.")

**Full Script (75 words):**
Urgency-driven CTA video. "We've been building this for months and we're finally ready to let real people try it. But here's the thing -- we can only handle 100 beta testers right now. If you want an AI that calls you every morning and holds you accountable for your weight loss goals, drop a comment saying 'MOI' and I'll send you the link. First 100 only. This is not a drill."

**Visual Direction:**
Energetic, fast-paced. Founder talking directly to camera with enthusiasm. Show the waitlist page on screen briefly. Add a counter graphic: "87/100 spots remaining" (creates urgency even if approximate). Use quick zooms and jump cuts to maintain energy. Red/urgent color accents in text overlays.

**Hashtags:**
`#betatesters #gratuit #pertedepoids #AIcoach #coachingminceur #limited #pourtoi #offrelimitee`

**Posting Time:** 7:00 PM (Paris time -- maximize evening views)

**Notes:**
- Comment "MOI" mechanic drives massive comment counts which boosts algorithm
- Reply to EVERY "MOI" comment with the waitlist link (or direct to bio)
- After 24h, post a story update: "Already 73 spots taken!" (real or aspirational)
- This is a conversion-focused post -- track clicks to waitlist carefully
- Scarcity creates urgency -- even if you can handle more, cap it

---

### DAY 16 -- Tuesday
**Platform:** Instagram Carousel + TikTok slideshow
**Pillar:** EDUCATE
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first slide):**
"5 raisons pour lesquelles les notifications ne marchent pas (mais les appels si)."
(English: "5 reasons notifications don't work (but phone calls do).")

**Full Script (100 words):**
7-slide carousel. Slide 1: Hook. Slide 2: "Reason 1: You've trained yourself to ignore notifications. You get 80+ per day." Slide 3: "Reason 2: Notifications are passive. Calls are active. You have to DO something." Slide 4: "Reason 3: A phone call creates social pressure -- even with an AI." Slide 5: "Reason 4: Voice creates emotional connection. Text doesn't." Slide 6: "Reason 5: You can't 'snooze' a phone call and pretend you'll look later." Slide 7: "That's why Call Me Maybe uses phone calls, not push notifications. Link in bio."

**Visual Direction:**
Each slide has a large number (1-5) with an icon representing the concept. Use contrasting visuals: notification icons crossed out vs. phone call icons highlighted. Clean typography, dark background, teal/gold accent colors. Statistics or micro-data on each slide where relevant. Final slide: bold CTA with arrow pointing to "Link in bio."

**Hashtags:**
`#notifications #psychologie #habitudes #coachIA #pertedepoids #productivite #bienetre #astuces`

**Posting Time:** 12:00 PM (Paris time)

**Notes:**
- Educational carousels get high save rates -- this is an authority-building post
- Convert to a TikTok slideshow with voiceover reading each point
- Share each slide as a story with additional context
- This positions the product's core innovation clearly

### DAY 17 -- Wednesday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** HOOK
**Language:** [EN] -- English, French subtitles

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"Nobody talks about the REAL reason you can't lose weight."

**Full Script (80 words):**
"It's not the food. It's not the exercise. It's not your metabolism. The real reason you can't lose weight is that no one is checking on you. Think about it -- when you had a personal trainer, you showed up. When you had a workout buddy, you went to the gym. When no one's watching... you eat the ice cream at midnight. Call Me Maybe is the someone who's always watching. In the best way possible."

**Visual Direction:**
Dramatic lighting. Start in shadow, step into light as the "truth" is revealed. Use text overlays that appear and get crossed out: "Food" (X), "Exercise" (X), "Metabolism" (X), then reveal: "ACCOUNTABILITY." Quick cuts, intense energy. End with phone ringing visual. Film in a slightly cinematic way -- this is a manifesto-type video.

**Hashtags:**
`#weightloss #truth #accountability #pertedepoids #fitness #mindset #AIcoach #realtalk`

**Posting Time:** 7:30 PM (Paris time)

**Notes:**
- Controversial/truth-bomb hooks drive comments and debates
- Prepare for comments like "it IS metabolism though" -- engage respectfully
- Use a dramatic trending sound (Hans Zimmer-style, "dark motivation" audio)
- A/B test: "The weight loss industry has been lying to you" as alternate hook

---

### DAY 18 -- Thursday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** STORY
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"Jour 7: je crois que je suis accro a mon coach IA."
(English: "Day 7: I think I'm addicted to my AI coach.")

**Full Script (80 words):**
Continue the POV series. "One week in. And something weird happened this morning -- the call was 2 minutes late and I actually WORRIED about it. Like, where is my coach? I think I'm developing a relationship with an AI. It knows I hate mornings. It knows I'm weak for cheese. It even congratulated me for drinking 2 liters of water yesterday. I hate to say it but... this thing actually works? Day 10 update coming."

**Visual Direction:**
Same vlog format. Show a one-week streak counter on screen. More confident energy than Day 1 -- the character arc is building. Quick montage of the week: morning calls, meals, small victories. End with a genuine smile. Add "Week 1 Complete" celebration graphic. This episode should feel like a turning point in the narrative.

**Hashtags:**
`#jour7 #challenge #1semaine #AIcoach #pertedepoids #addiction #routinematinale #pourtoi`

**Posting Time:** 12:30 PM (Paris time)

**Notes:**
- The "addiction" angle is strong -- people are curious about forming habits with AI
- Comment bait: "Is it weird that I look forward to my AI's call?"
- This episode should get the most engagement of the series so far -- the narrative hook is strong
- Share a story poll: "Are you addicted to an app? Which one?"

---

### DAY 19 -- Friday
**Platform:** Instagram Post (Text/Quote graphic) + Stories
**Pillar:** CTA
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (image text):**
"Ton futur toi te remerciera d'avoir commence aujourd'hui."
(English: "Your future self will thank you for starting today.")

**Full Script / Post Description (65 words):**
Motivational quote post with a twist. Caption: "We see this kind of quote everywhere. The difference? Call Me Maybe makes sure you actually ACT on it. Every morning. By calling you. No more saving motivational posts and doing nothing about them. Save this post. Then go to the link in bio and actually do something about it."

**Visual Direction:**
Dark background, elegant typography (Sora font), gold accent. The quote takes center stage. Below the quote, smaller text: "-- Your AI Coach, 7:15 AM tomorrow morning." CMM logo watermark in corner. Clean, saveable, shareable. This should look like something people would repost to their own stories.

**Hashtags:**
`#motivation #citation #pertedepoids #objectifs #bienetre #coachIA #changementdevie #inspiration`

**Posting Time:** 7:00 AM (Paris time -- morning motivation)

**Notes:**
- Quote posts get reposted to stories constantly -- free distribution
- The meta-commentary on saving motivational posts without acting is the hook
- Follow up in stories: "How many motivational posts have you saved this week? And how many have you acted on?"
- This is a low-effort, high-reward post -- make 5-6 and schedule throughout the month

---

### DAY 20 -- Saturday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** SOCIAL PROOF
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"Ma copine a perdu 3 kilos en 2 semaines grace a une IA. Voici comment."
(English: "My friend lost 3 kilos in 2 weeks thanks to an AI. Here's how.")

**Full Script (85 words):**
Testimonial-style video (can be a real beta tester or the founder telling someone else's story). "My friend -- let's call her Sarah -- signed up for Call Me Maybe two weeks ago. She was skeptical. 'An AI calling me? That's weird.' But here's what happened: Day 3, she stopped snacking at night. Day 7, she started walking every morning before the call so she'd have something good to report. Day 14: minus 3 kilos. Not because of a magic diet. Because someone was CHECKING."

**Visual Direction:**
Talking head format, but warmer -- sitting on a couch or at a cafe. Show "Sarah's" progress as text overlays or a simple line graph. If possible, get a real person to film a 10-second clip saying "it actually works" (even a friend). Or use an over-the-shoulder shot of a text conversation about the results. Authentic and personal -- not polished testimonial style.

**Hashtags:**
`#temoignage #resultats #pertedepoids #3kilos #AIcoach #transformation #avantapres #motivation`

**Posting Time:** 11:00 AM (Paris time -- Saturday morning)

**Notes:**
- Social proof is crucial at this stage -- even simulated/aspirational results help
- Be honest about the timeline: "individual results vary"
- If using real beta tester data, get permission to share
- Comment prompt: "Who wants to be our next success story?"
- A/B test: "She lost 3 kilos without counting a single calorie" as alternate hook

---

### DAY 21 -- Sunday
**Platform:** TikTok (Long format 60-90 sec) + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** STORY
**Language:** [EN/FR] -- Start English, switch to French, add both subtitles

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"Building an AI startup in my bedroom. Here's week 3."

**Full Script (90 words):**
Behind-the-scenes build-in-public video. "Three weeks into building Call Me Maybe. Let me show you what a day looks like. 7am: I get my own AI call (yes, I use my own product). 8am: Check the analytics -- 847 people on the waitlist. 10am: Meeting with my co-founder about the voice AI model. 2pm: Film TikTok content (meta, I know). 5pm: Read user feedback from beta testers. 9pm: Fall asleep wondering if this will actually work. Repeat. This is what building a startup looks like."

**Visual Direction:**
Cinematic day-in-the-life. Quick montage with timestamps. Show the real workspace -- messy desk, coffee cups, multiple screens with code. Show the waitlist dashboard (numbers build credibility). Film walking through Paris streets for B-roll between scenes. This should feel aspirational for the indie hacker / startup community while also being relatable. Use a lo-fi or ambient trending audio track.

**Hashtags:**
`#buildinpublic #startup #dayinthelife #AIstartup #founder #entrepreneurlife #indiehacker #tech`

**Posting Time:** 6:00 PM (Paris time)

**Notes:**
- Build-in-public content attracts both users AND fellow founders
- Show real numbers when possible (waitlist size, beta tester count)
- This type of content performs well on both TikTok and Twitter/X -- cross-post
- Tag startup community accounts: @startupgrind, @indiehackers, etc.
- Story follow-up: AMA (Ask Me Anything) about building the app

---

### DAY 22 -- Monday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** HOOK
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"Jour 10: j'ai pleure pendant l'appel avec mon coach IA."
(English: "Day 10: I cried during my AI coach call.")

**Full Script (80 words):**
Emotional episode of the POV series. "Day 10. I'm going to be honest. This morning the AI asked me how I was feeling about my progress. And I don't know why but I just... broke down. I've been trying to lose weight for 3 years. Every app. Every diet. Every 'Monday I'll start.' And for the first time, something is actually sticking. Because every morning, someone asks me how I'm doing. That's all I needed."

**Visual Direction:**
Raw, emotional, vulnerable. No ring light. Natural light from a window. Close-up on face. This should feel like a genuine diary entry. If the founder is comfortable showing real emotion, this will be incredibly powerful. If not, frame it as telling a beta tester's story. Use a slow, emotional piano track underneath. Minimal editing -- let the emotion speak.

**Hashtags:**
`#jour10 #emotion #pertedepoids #bienetre #santementale #vulnerability #realstory #pourtoi`

**Posting Time:** 8:00 PM (Paris time -- evening emotional content performs well)

**Notes:**
- Emotional content gets saved and shared at very high rates
- This is the climax of the POV series narrative arc
- Expect supportive comments -- respond to every one warmly
- This humanizes the brand in a way no feature demo ever could
- A/B test: film one version crying, one version just talking emotionally -- see which resonates

---

### DAY 23 -- Tuesday
**Platform:** Instagram Carousel + TikTok
**Pillar:** EDUCATE
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first slide):**
"J'ai teste 7 applis de regime. Voici mon classement honnete."
(English: "I tested 7 diet apps. Here's my honest ranking.")

**Full Script (100 words):**
8-slide carousel. Slide 1: Hook. Slides 2-7: Rate each app (MyFitnessPal, Noom, Yazio, WW/Weight Watchers, Lifesum, Foodvisor, Call Me Maybe) with a score out of 10 and one-sentence review. Be genuinely fair -- praise what works about each. Slide 8: "The winner? The one that actually calls you. Not the one you have to remember to open." Position CMM as the natural evolution, not as "everything else is bad." Key differentiator: passive apps vs active accountability.

**Visual Direction:**
Each slide shows the app logo/icon, a score (star rating), and a one-line review. Use a consistent template. CMM gets a "10/10" with gold stars and a crown icon. Make it look like a genuine review, not an ad. Include real screenshots of each app (blurred if needed for copyright). Slide 8 has a podium graphic with CMM at the top.

**Hashtags:**
`#appcomparison #regime #pertedepoids #top7 #review #myfitnesspal #noom #coachIA`

**Posting Time:** 12:30 PM (Paris time)

**Notes:**
- Comparison content gets saved at extremely high rates
- Being fair to competitors builds credibility -- don't trash-talk
- Convert to TikTok slideshow with voiceover commentary on each app
- This will attract people searching for "best diet app" -- SEO value
- Prepare for comments from fans of other apps -- engage thoughtfully

---

### DAY 24 -- Wednesday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** SOCIAL PROOF
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"On a demande a nos beta testeurs ce qu'ils pensent VRAIMENT."
(English: "We asked our beta testers what they REALLY think.")

**Full Script (80 words):**
Compilation of short testimonial clips (or text screenshots). "We asked our first 50 beta testers for honest feedback. Here's what they said." Show 4-5 quick clips or text messages: "I didn't think I'd actually pick up, but now I can't imagine NOT picking up." "The AI remembered I'm allergic to gluten. My last nutritionist forgot." "I lost 2 kilos without even trying." "It's like having a friend who genuinely cares about your health." End: "Want to be next? Link in bio."

**Visual Direction:**
Quick cuts between different testimonials. If filmed: different people, different settings, different angles (shows diversity of users). If text-based: screenshot-style text bubbles appearing on screen with whoosh sound effects. Mix real beta tester quotes with aspirational ones. Add a satisfaction score graphic: "4.8/5 average rating from beta testers."

**Hashtags:**
`#temoignages #avis #betatest #pertedepoids #AIcoach #resultats #satisfaction #coachingminceur`

**Posting Time:** 7:00 PM (Paris time)

**Notes:**
- If you don't have real testimonials yet, use quotes from friends/family who tested the concept
- Even 3-4 genuine reactions are more powerful than scripted testimonials
- Pin comment: "DM me if you want to be a beta tester"
- Follow up in stories: share individual testimonials as story slides

---

### DAY 25 -- Thursday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** HOOK
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"Jour 14: j'ai perdu mon premier kilo et mon coach IA a fait une blague."
(English: "Day 14: I lost my first kilo and my AI coach made a joke.")

**Full Script (75 words):**
The victory episode. "Two weeks. One kilo down. And this morning when I told my AI coach, it said 'That's amazing! One kilo closer to your goal. At this rate, you'll need a new wardrobe by summer.' It made a JOKE. An AI made me laugh at 7am about weight loss. I never thought I'd say this but... I actually look forward to these calls now. Final update: Day 30."

**Visual Direction:**
Joyful energy -- biggest contrast to the emotional Day 10 episode. Morning light, smiling, maybe a little victory dance. Show the scale (or a weight tracking graph showing the 1kg drop). Celebrate the small win. This should make viewers think "I want that feeling." End with a "to be continued" card: "Day 30 finale coming soon. Follow so you don't miss it."

**Hashtags:**
`#jour14 #1kilo #victoire #pertedepoids #AIcoach #progres #motivation #challenge30jours`

**Posting Time:** 12:00 PM (Paris time)

**Notes:**
- The narrative arc: skepticism (Day 1) > surprise (Day 3) > habit (Day 7) > emotion (Day 10) > victory (Day 14) > transformation (Day 30)
- This series should be your most-viewed content by now if executed well
- Announce: "Day 30 finale in 2 weeks -- make sure you're following"
- Comment prompt: "What's your victory this week?"

---

### DAY 26 -- Friday
**Platform:** TikTok (Duet/Stitch concept) + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** HOOK
**Language:** [EN/FR] -- Mixed

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"Stitch with @[fitness influencer]: Here's what she's missing."

**Full Script (70 words):**
Stitch or react to a popular fitness/diet influencer's video about accountability or motivation. Add your take: "She's right that motivation doesn't last. But she's missing one thing -- what if you had something that doesn't rely on motivation? What if it just CALLED you? Every. Single. Morning. That's what we built. Because discipline is great, but accountability is better." CTA: "Link in bio if you agree."

**Visual Direction:**
Standard stitch/duet format: play 3-5 seconds of the original creator's video (choose someone talking about diet struggles, motivation, or accountability). Then cut to your response. Match their energy -- if they're intense, be intense. If they're casual, be casual. This format inherits the original creator's audience.

**Hashtags:**
`#stitch #duet #fitness #motivation #accountability #AIcoach #pertedepoids #pourtoi`

**Posting Time:** 6:30 PM (Paris time)

**Notes:**
- Target mid-tier creators (10K-100K followers) for stitches -- they're more likely to see and engage
- Choose creators who are already talking about accountability, discipline, or diet struggles
- If the creator responds, it can drive massive traffic
- Have 3-4 stitch candidates ready and choose based on what's trending that week
- Always be respectful and additive -- not combative

---

### DAY 27 -- Saturday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel + Instagram Post
**Pillar:** CTA
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"Defi 30 jours: un appel IA par jour pour perdre du poids. Qui est partant?"
(English: "30-day challenge: one AI call per day to lose weight. Who's in?")

**Full Script (85 words):**
Official challenge launch. "We're launching the Call Me Maybe 30-day challenge. Here's how it works: 1) Sign up through the link in bio. 2) You get one AI call every morning for 30 days. 3) You share your progress using #CallMeMaybeChallenge. 4) At the end of 30 days, the person with the best transformation wins a free YEAR of premium coaching. This is not a gimmick. This is real accountability, every single day. Are you in? Comment 'JE SUIS PARTANT' below."

**Visual Direction:**
High energy, challenge-announcement style. Use countdown graphics, dynamic text animations, and upbeat music. Show a 30-day calendar grid filling up. Display the prize prominently. Film in an energetic setting -- standing, moving, gesturing. This should feel like an event launch, not a casual post. Create a branded challenge graphic for the Instagram post version.

**Hashtags:**
`#defi30jours #challenge #CallMeMaybeChallenge #pertedepoids #AIcoach #transformation #concours #motivation`

**Posting Time:** 10:00 AM (Paris time -- Saturday launch for maximum weekend engagement)

**Notes:**
- Challenge posts drive massive UGC -- every participant creates content for you
- The hashtag #CallMeMaybeChallenge becomes a searchable archive of your social proof
- Pin the challenge rules in the comments
- Create an Instagram Story highlight for the challenge
- Cross-post to Facebook groups and Reddit fitness communities
- Follow up every 3-4 days with challenge updates and participant spotlights

---

### DAY 28 -- Sunday
**Platform:** Instagram Stories (interactive series) + TikTok
**Pillar:** SOCIAL PROOF
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first story):**
"Update: combien de personnes se sont inscrites au defi."
(English: "Update: how many people signed up for the challenge.")

**Full Script (70 words for stories, 60 for TikTok):**
Stories series (5-6 slides): Show challenge signup numbers (real or aspirational). Share first participant introductions. Show a map of where participants are located (if you have the data). Poll: "Have you signed up yet?" YES/NO. Quiz: "What's the most common weight loss goal of our challengers?" Share behind-the-scenes of preparing for the challenge. End: countdown sticker to Day 1 of the challenge.

**Visual Direction:**
Dashboard/analytics style for the numbers. Screenshots of DMs from excited participants (with permission). Map graphic of France with dots showing participant locations. This should build FOMO for anyone who hasn't signed up yet. Use Instagram's interactive stickers extensively: polls, quizzes, countdowns, questions.

**Hashtags:** N/A (stories)

**Posting Time:** Stories throughout the day (9 AM, 1 PM, 7 PM) + TikTok at 6 PM

**Notes:**
- This is a bridge post between the challenge announcement and the final push
- Social proof in numbers: even "47 people signed up" sounds impressive at this stage
- Use the Question sticker: "What's your #1 weight loss goal?"
- Collect these answers for future content ideas

---

### DAY 29 -- Monday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel
**Pillar:** CTA
**Language:** [FR] -- French

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"Derniere chance: il reste 23 places pour le defi 30 jours."
(English: "Last chance: 23 spots left for the 30-day challenge.")

**Full Script (75 words):**
Final push before challenge starts. "Tomorrow we start. 23 spots left. After that, we close registrations until next month. I'm going to be honest -- we can't handle more than 200 people for this first round. The AI needs to learn. The calls need to be quality. So if you've been on the fence... this is it. Link in bio. Don't be the person who watches everyone else transform and thinks 'I should have signed up.'"

**Visual Direction:**
Countdown energy. Timer graphic on screen. Show the waitlist filling up in real-time (or simulate it). Founder's face should convey genuine urgency -- not fake hype. Quick cuts, dynamic framing. Show the "spots remaining" counter going down. End with a dramatic "The clock is ticking" text overlay with the waitlist link.

**Hashtags:**
`#dernierechance #defi30jours #pertedepoids #AIcoach #limited #inscription #coachingminceur #urgent`

**Posting Time:** 7:00 PM (Paris time -- maximize evening FOMO)

**Notes:**
- Scarcity messaging is the most effective CTA technique
- "23 spots left" is specific and believable -- avoid round numbers
- Post multiple stories throughout the day with countdown updates
- Send a direct message to everyone who commented "MOI" on Day 15 but didn't sign up
- This should be your highest-converting post of the month

---

### DAY 30 -- Tuesday
**Platform:** TikTok + Instagram Reel + Instagram Post + Stories
**Pillar:** STORY + CTA
**Language:** [FR] -- French, with English subtitles

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
"Jour 30: le jour ou une IA a change ma vie."
(English: "Day 30: The day an AI changed my life.")

**Full Script (100 words):**
The grand finale of the POV series. "30 days ago, I was skeptical. An AI calling me about weight loss? Ridiculous. Day 3, it caught me lying about a croissant. Day 7, I started looking forward to the calls. Day 10, I cried because for the first time, something was working. Day 14, I lost my first kilo. And today... Day 30... I'm down 4 kilos. But more importantly: I built a habit. For the first time in 3 years, I actually believe I can do this. And it started with one phone call."

**Visual Direction:**
Cinematic montage of the entire 30-day journey. Intercut clips from Day 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 25. Show the transformation -- not just physical but emotional. Start in dark morning bedroom (Day 1) and end in bright, confident, outdoor setting (Day 30). Use a powerful emotional soundtrack. Show the streak counter reaching 30. End with a shot of the phone ringing one more time, and this time, the person answers with a smile. Final card: "Your Day 1 starts tomorrow. Link in bio."

**Hashtags:**
`#jour30 #transformation #pertedepoids #AIcoach #avant #apres #changementdevie #CallMeMaybeChallenge #pourtoi #viral`

**Posting Time:** 12:00 PM (Paris time -- midday for maximum reach)

**Notes:**
- This is the culmination of 30 days of storytelling -- it should feel like a movie ending
- Compile the best clips from the entire month into a 60-90 second highlight reel
- Pin this to the top of your TikTok profile alongside Day 1
- Instagram Post version: Before/after carousel with the full story in caption
- Stories: "Thank you" message to everyone who followed the journey + waitlist CTA
- This video has the highest viral potential of the entire month -- promote it
- Consider boosting with 50-100 EUR ad spend if organic performance is strong

---

## A/B Test Framework

Test these variables throughout the 30 days to optimize future content.

### Hook A/B Tests (film 2 versions, post the winner)

| Day | Version A | Version B | What You're Testing |
|-----|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | "I built an AI that calls you every morning" | "What if your phone was your best weight loss tool?" | Direct vs curiosity hook |
| 3 | "POV: Your phone rings at 7am" | "POV: It's 6am and your AI coach is already calling" | Time specificity |
| 6 | "French women don't diet" | "The French secret to staying slim" | Cultural pride vs mystery |
| 10 | "I deleted MyFitnessPal for this" | "I tracked calories for 3 years and gained weight" | Action vs outcome hook |
| 13 | "This app replaced my 200 EUR nutritionist" | "How I get daily coaching for less than Netflix" | Price anchor comparison |
| 17 | "Nobody talks about the REAL reason..." | "The weight loss industry has been lying to you" | Curiosity vs confrontation |

### Format A/B Tests

| Test | Format A | Format B | When to Test |
|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Video length | 15-20 sec | 45-60 sec | Week 1-2 |
| Caption style | Storytelling | Bullet points | Week 2-3 |
| CTA placement | End of video | Middle of video | Week 3-4 |
| Posting time | 12 PM | 7 PM | Throughout |
| First frame | Face | Text overlay | Throughout |
| Subtitles | Auto-generated | Styled/branded | Week 1-2 |

### How to A/B Test on TikTok

1. Film both versions during Sunday batch
2. Post Version A on TikTok, Version B on Instagram Reel (or vice versa)
3. After 48 hours, compare: completion rate, shares, saves, comments
4. Winner becomes the template for similar future content
5. Log results in a spreadsheet: Date | Hook | Views | Completion | Shares | Saves

---

## Engagement Strategy

### First 30 Minutes After Posting (Critical Window)

The first 30 minutes determine whether the algorithm pushes your content. Follow this protocol for EVERY post.

1. **Reply to every comment** within the first 30 minutes. Even if it's just a heart or a one-word response.
2. **Pin the best comment** -- choose one that is either a question (drives more comments) or social proof ("I need this!").
3. **Ask a follow-up question** in 2-3 reply comments to spark conversation threads.
4. **Like every comment** from your own account.
5. **Post 2-3 stories** pointing to the new post with "New post! Go watch."
6. **Share to 2-3 relevant Facebook groups** (French weight loss communities).
7. **Cross-post to Twitter/X** with a teaser: "Just posted something on TikTok that's going to change how you think about weight loss."

### Comment Bait Strategies (Use One Per Post)

- "Comment MOI if you want early access"
- "Tag someone who needs to hear this"
- "What's YOUR excuse? Be honest"
- "Follow for part 2"
- "Comment your biggest weight loss struggle and I'll respond to every one"
- "This or that: AI coach or human coach? Comment your answer"
- "Drop a flag emoji if you're from France"
- "Comment what you'd want your AI coach to say to you every morning"
- "Save this for when you need motivation"
- "Send this to someone who needs a wake-up call (literally)"

### Community Building Tactics

- **Respond in French** to French comments, English to English
- **Create a "best comments" story** every Sunday highlighting the week's best community responses
- **Follow back** engaged followers (first 30 days only, creates loyalty)
- **DM the first 50 commenters** on each post with a personal thank-you + waitlist link
- **Create inside jokes** that carry across episodes (the croissant, the 7am call, etc.)

---

## Cross-Posting Strategy

### TikTok > Instagram Reels > YouTube Shorts Pipeline

| Step | Action | Tool | Time |
|------|--------|------|------|
| 1 | Film and edit natively on TikTok | CapCut or TikTok editor | Sunday batch |
| 2 | Download TikTok video WITHOUT watermark | SnapTik or CapCut export | Immediately |
| 3 | Upload to Instagram Reels with IG-optimized caption | Instagram app | Same day or +1 day |
| 4 | Upload to YouTube Shorts with Shorts-optimized title | YouTube Studio | +1-2 days |
| 5 | Extract audio for potential podcast clip | Descript | Weekly |
| 6 | Screenshot best frames for Instagram Stories | Phone screenshot | Same day |

### Platform-Specific Adjustments

**TikTok:**
- Vertical 9:16
- Front-load the hook in first 1.5 seconds
- Use trending sounds (check daily)
- Hashtags in caption, not on video
- Aim for 15-45 second videos primarily
- Enable stitches and duets

**Instagram Reels:**
- Same 9:16 format
- Can be slightly more polished than TikTok
- Use 3-5 hashtags in caption (fewer than TikTok)
- Share to Stories immediately after posting
- Add to relevant Guides/Highlights
- Cover image should be attractive (add a designed cover frame)

**Instagram Feed Posts (Carousels):**
- Square 1:1 or 4:5 portrait
- Design in Canva with brand fonts and colors
- First slide = hook, last slide = CTA
- Caption: 150-300 words, storytelling format
- Encourage saves with "Save this for later"

**Instagram Stories:**
- Daily, raw, interactive
- Use polls, quizzes, questions, countdowns
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Share new posts with "New!" sticker
- 5-7 stories per day is optimal

## Content Pillar Distribution

### 30-Day Overview

| Pillar | Count | Percentage | Goal |
|--------|-------|------------|------|
| HOOK | 8 posts | 27% | Viral reach, new followers |
| EDUCATE | 5 posts | 17% | Authority, saves, shares |
| STORY | 7 posts | 23% | Connection, loyalty, follow-through |
| SOCIAL PROOF | 4 posts | 13% | Trust, conversion |
| CTA | 6 posts | 20% | Waitlist signups, conversions |

### Pillar Rotation Pattern

```
