## Moderation Guidelines

### Rules (posted in #rules)

1. Be kind. Weight loss is personal. No shaming, no judging.
2. No diet evangelism. Don't push specific diets on others.
3. No medical advice. If someone needs help, suggest they see a professional.
4. No self-promotion without permission. DM Aaron first.
5. Trigger warnings for eating disorder content.
6. No before/after photos without consent.
7. Respect privacy. What's shared here stays here.
8. English and French both welcome. Default: French.

### Auto-Moderation
- Filter: slurs, spam links, excessive caps
- Anti-raid protection: verification level medium
- Slow mode on #general during peak hours (30 seconds)
- New members: 10-minute wait before posting (prevent raid bots)

## Conversion Funnel

```
Free Discord member
    → Engages in daily check-ins
        → Sees CMM users posting streaks
            → Curious about the AI phone call feature
                → Tries free trial
                    → Becomes paying user
                        → Invites friends to Discord
                            → Cycle continues
```

**Key conversion moment:** When a free Discord member sees CMM users consistently posting 14+ day streaks and asks "what's CMM?" — that's when the product sells itself.
