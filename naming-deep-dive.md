## 1. Current Name Inventory

### Names in Logos Page (8)
| Name | Concept | Score | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|-------|
| Call Me Coach | Direct, descriptive | — | Too generic, hard to trademark |
| FitCall | Fitness + call | — | Sounds like a fitness app, not weight loss |
| FitVox | Fitness + voice | — | Tech-sounding but cold |
| Call Me Baby | Playful, memorable | — | Confusion with Carly Rae Jepsen song |
| Reveilla | Wake-up call (FR/EN) | 19/20 | Top recommendation in strategy |
| Appello | Latin "to call" | 17/20 | Beautiful, multilingual |
| Allore | Allo (FR phone) + ore (gold) | 17/20 | Very French, elegant |
| Déclic | "The click moment" (FR) | 16/20 | Powerful French concept |

### Names in Strategy Page (28 evaluated, top 5 shown)
| Rank | Name | Score | Domain |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Reveilla | 19/20 | reveilla.ai ~$80/yr |
| 2 | Appello | 17/20 | appello.ai ~$80/yr |
| 3 | Allore | 17/20 | allore.ai ~$80/yr |
| 4 | RingSteady | 16/20 | .com + .ai both available |
| 5 | Déclic | 16/20 | declic.ai ~$80/yr |

### Names NOT in Logos or Strategy
The pitch decks (FR/EN) don't have a naming section at all — major gap to fix.

### What's Missing
1. **Human first names** — No persona-like names (Maya, Luna, etc.)
2. **Weight loss specific** — None of the 28 names say "weight loss"
3. **French prénom-style** — No warm, human-sounding options
4. **GLP-1/health** — Nothing for the medical positioning

## 2. Naming Pattern Analysis: Weight Loss Apps

### How Top Apps Are Named

| Pattern | Examples | Strength | Weakness |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Made-up word** | Noom, Yazio, Lifesum | Unique, trademarkable | No meaning, needs marketing spend |
| **Descriptive** | MyFitnessPal, CalorieCam, FatSecret | Clear purpose | Generic, forgettable |
| **Action verb** | Lose It!, Rise, Strides | Motivational | Can be generic |
| **Human name** | Pi.ai, Replika, Alexa | Warm, personal | Can feel gimmicky |
| **Acronym** | WW (Weight Watchers) | Simple | Loses meaning |
| **Metaphor** | Noom (moon backwards), Glow, Thrive | Creative | Meaning not obvious |
| **French-specific** | Petit BamBou, Yuka, Doctolib | Local appeal | Limits global expansion |

### Key Insight: App Name vs Coach Name

| App | App Name | AI/Coach Name | Relationship |
|-----|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Replika | Replika | User-chosen | App = brand, persona = personal |
| Pi.ai | Pi | Pi | Same name |
| Character.ai | Character.ai | User-chosen | Platform vs individual |
| Duolingo | Duolingo | Duo (owl) | App = brand, mascot = character |
| Noom | Noom | Human coaches (real names) | App = brand, coaches = people |
| **CMM (current)** | **Call Me Maybe** | **Maya** | App = brand, coach = persona |

**Recommendation:** Keep the separation. The APP name is the brand (shows on phone, in App Store). The COACH name is the persona (what users hear in calls). This allows multiple coach personas without rebranding.

## 3. New Name Ideas: Weight Loss Specific

### Category A: Human First Names (Coach Persona Names)

These are for the **coach character**, not the app. Users hear this name in calls.

| Name | Origin | Feel | Why It Works for Weight Loss |
|------|--------|------|------------------------------|
| **Maya** | Sanskrit/Hebrew | Warm, wise | Current choice. Means "water/illusion." Universal. |
| **Alma** | Latin/Spanish | Nurturing | Means "soul/nourishing." Perfect for food coaching. |
| **Léonie** | French | Elegant | Lion = strength. Very French. |
| **Camille** | French | Gender-neutral | Classic French, works for all users |
| **Inès** | Arabic/French | Modern | Popular in France, elegant, approachable |
| **Nora** | Arabic/Irish | Warm | Means "light." Short, memorable. |
| **Sasha** | Russian/French | Energetic | Gender-neutral. Sporty feel. |
| **Élia** | Hebrew/French | Soft | "My God." Spiritual without being religious. |
| **Mila** | Slavic | Friendly | Means "gracious." Rising popularity in France. |

## 5. Strategic Recommendations

### App Name (The Brand)

**Primary recommendation: Reveilla** (score 26/30)
- Strongest bilingual resonance
- "Reveil" = alarm/wake-up in French
- Military precision + morning ritual
- reveilla.ai available
- Easy to spell, pronounce, remember

**Alternatives by positioning:**
- **For weight loss emphasis:** Fondre.ai ("melting") or Élance.ai ("slender + momentum")
- **For French market emphasis:** Allore.ai ("Allo" + gold) or Déclic.ai ("the click")
- **For global ambition:** RingSteady (.com + .ai available)

### Coach Name (The Persona)

**Primary:** Maya (already established, universal)
**Weight-loss specific alternative:** Alma ("nourishing soul")
**French-specific alternative:** Camille (gender-neutral, classic French)

### Naming Architecture

```
BRAND: Reveilla (or chosen name)
  └── COACH PERSONA: Maya (default)
       ├── Alternative: Alma (nurturing)
       ├── Alternative: Max (energetic)
       └── Alternative: Sage (wise)
  └── TAGLINE: "Your AI coach calls you every morning"
  └── DOMAIN: reveilla.ai
  └── APP STORE: "Reveilla — AI Coach"
```

## 6. Weight Loss Naming Insights

### What Research Says

1. **Names that evoke transformation** outperform clinical names in health apps (Noom > "CalorieTracker")
2. **Short names** (1-2 syllables) have 23% higher recall in app stores
3. **French consumers** prefer names that feel premium/elegant over fun/playful
4. **Dual-meaning names** create conversation ("What does Reveilla mean?" → brand story)
5. **The app name should NOT include "weight loss"** — it stigmatizes. Users don't want "Weight Loss App" on their phone screen.

### The "Phone Screen Test"
Would users feel comfortable if someone saw this app on their phone?
- "MyFitnessPal" → neutral ✓
- "Fat Secret" → embarrassing ✗
- "Noom" → neutral ✓ (nobody knows what it means)
- "Reveilla" → intriguing ✓
- "Fondre" → might feel too direct about weight

### The "Conversation Test"
"I'm using [APP_NAME] to get healthier"
- "I'm using Reveilla" → "What's that?" → brand story opportunity ✓
- "I'm using Fondre" → "Fondre? Like melting?" → too on-the-nose
- "I'm using Déclic" → "What's Déclic?" → "It means the click, the moment everything changes" ✓

## 7. Domain Strategy

### Immediate Actions (Register Now)

| Domain | Est. Cost | Priority |
|--------|----------|----------|
| reveilla.ai | ~$80/yr | P0 — register immediately |
| ringsteady.com + .ai | ~$100/yr total | P1 — backup |
| allore.ai | ~$80/yr | P1 — strong French option |
| declic.ai | ~$80/yr | P2 — nice to have |
| fondre.ai | ~$80/yr | P2 — weight loss specific |
| elance.ai | ~$80/yr | P2 — elegant option |

### Note on "Call Me Maybe"
The current working name has trademark issues (Carly Rae Jepsen's song) and isn't ideal for App Store (too long, not unique). It works as a project codename but should transition to the final brand name before launch.

## 8. Next Steps

1. **Decision needed:** Choose final app name (Aaron + Ata decision)
2. **Register domains** immediately for top 2-3 choices
3. **Update all assets** once name is final:
   - Pitch decks (add naming section)
   - Landing pages
   - War Room
   - Social media profiles
   - App Store listing
4. **Keep "Maya" as default coach name** (or consider Alma)
5. **Logo refresh** with final name using the 3 concepts from logos.html
