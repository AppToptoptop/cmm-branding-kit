| **Emotional trigger** | Read that 67% of people regain weight after stopping GLP-1s |

### Psychographic Profile

- When she eventually stops Wegovy, the habits (and the calls) continue
- The coaching focuses on **behavioral change**, not just calorie restriction
- She's already paying for Wegovy (€200-300/month) — €9.90 is negligible
- She's motivated and compliant — perfect for high retention
