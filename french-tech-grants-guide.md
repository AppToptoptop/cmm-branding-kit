## 1. La French Tech Ecosystem & Label

### What Is La French Tech?

La French Tech is the French government's initiative to promote and support the startup ecosystem in France. It operates through several layers:

- **Mission French Tech** -- the government body that coordinates everything (under the Ministry of Economy)
- **French Tech Capitals & Communities** -- local hubs (16 Capitales + 31 Communautes in France, 66 abroad) accredited every 3 years
- **Named programs** -- French Tech Next40/120, French Tech 2030, French Tech Tremplin, etc.

**Key distinction:** There is no single "La French Tech label" that individual startups apply for. Instead, startups participate in specific programs or join local French Tech communities. The label system applies to the regional hubs themselves (Capitales and Communautes), not to individual companies.

### How CMM Can Engage with La French Tech

#### A. Join Your Local French Tech Community

- **What:** Become a member of your local French Tech Capital (e.g., French Tech Paris if based in Ile-de-France)
- **How:** Visit the local community website, attend events, register as a member
- **Cost:** Free
- **Benefits:**
  - Access to networking events and mentorship
  - Visibility within the ecosystem
  - Connection to partner organizations (Bpifrance, Business France, INPI, CNIL, etc.)
  - Referrals to funding programs
- **Tip for a 2-person startup:** This is a no-brainer first step. Join, show up at events, build relationships with the local ecosystem managers

#### B. French Tech 2030 Program (Aspirational -- Not Immediate)

- **What:** A 2-year support program for emerging startups developing solutions in strategic sectors (AI, health, cybersecurity, quantum, etc.)

## 2. BPI France Grants

Bpifrance is France's public investment bank and the primary source of startup grants. In 2025, Bpifrance announced a massive 10 billion EUR AI investment plan through 2029, covering foundation models, AI infrastructure, and AI-integrating companies. CMM is squarely in this strategic focus area.

### A. Bourse French Tech (Standard)

**The #1 grant CMM should apply for immediately.**

- **Amount:** Up to 30,000 EUR (subsidy, non-repayable)
- **Coverage:** Up to 70% of projected expenses
- **Duration:** Up to 24 months
- **Purpose:** Validate technological concept, test a prototype, refine go-to-market strategy, prepare business plan

- **CMM fit:** This is a later-stage instrument. Target this once you have a validated prototype and want to scale the R&D. Note: this is a repayable advance, not a pure grant.

### E. Pret d'Amorcage (Seed Loan)

Two variants exist:

#### Pret d'Amorcage Invest EU (Pre-fundraise)
- **Amount:** 50,000-100,000 EUR (up to 300,000 EUR with regional guarantee)
- **Terms:** 8 years, 3-year grace period on principal repayment, fixed rate
- **Purpose:** Bridge financing before a fundraise
- **Eligibility:**
  - Innovative PME (<250 employees)

  - In seed phase
- **No personal guarantee or collateral required**

#### Pret d'Amorcage Investissement Invest EU (Post-fundraise)
- **Amount:** 100,000-1,000,000 EUR (up to 2M EUR with derogation)
- **Terms:** 8 years, 3-year grace period, quarterly repayments
- **Purpose:** Complement a seed fundraise
- **Eligibility:**
  - Innovative PME less than 8 years old

- **CMM fit:** The pre-fundraise variant is interesting once CMM has received the Bourse French Tech (which qualifies as the required prior innovation grant). The post-fundraise variant becomes relevant after a seed round.

### F. AI-Specific Programs

#### AI Booster France 2030
- **What:** Program to accelerate AI adoption in French companies
- **Context:** Part of the 10B EUR Bpifrance AI investment announced in 2025
- **URL:** https://www.bpifrance.fr (search for "IA Booster")
- **CMM relevance:** Monitor for new calls targeting AI health startups

#### France 2030 Digital Health Acceleration
- **What:** Calls for projects to evaluate digital medical devices (including AI)
- **Budget per project:** 300,000-1,200,000 EUR over 12-24 months

8. **Detailed budget** for the innovation project
9. **IP strategy** (patents filed or planned, trade secrets)

---

## 3. AXA Health Patronage Fund

### Overview

The Mutuelles AXA health patronage program (Mecenat Sante) funds health research and innovation projects. The program was created in 2022 for a 3-year period and renewed in April 2024, with an overall budget of 45 million EUR.

In 2025, 14 new projects were funded for a total of 13.9 million EUR.

### Priority Themes (Directly Relevant to CMM)

The program covers:
- **Chronic diseases in young people** (obesity, asthma, allergies) -- directly relevant
- **Mental health**
- **E-health for young people and elderly** -- directly relevant
- **New technologies and AI for improving patient care** -- directly relevant
- **Prevention in health** -- the core of CMM's mission

### How to Apply

The program operates exclusively through competitive calls for projects (appels a projets).

**Process:**
1. **Phase 1 -- Pre-selection:** Submit a preliminary project description via an online form when the call opens
2. **Phase 2 -- Full application:** If pre-selected, receive a link to submit a complete dossier
3. **Final selection:** Projects reviewed and selected by a jury

**Key dates (based on 2025 cycle -- monitor for 2026):**
- Call for projects launch: Typically March
- Phase 2 form opens: June 11 (2025 date)
- Phase 2 deadline: July 14 (2025 date)
- Results: Announced after jury review

**Contact:** service.mecenatsante@axa.fr

### Important Caveats for CMM

- The program traditionally funds **research institutions, hospitals, and non-profit organizations**, not commercial startups
- To be eligible, CMM would likely need to **partner with a research institution** (university hospital, INSERM lab, etc.) and submit a joint project
- The partnership angle could work: CMM provides the AI coaching technology, a research lab runs a clinical study on its efficacy for weight loss
- This is a medium-term play requiring relationship-building with academic partners

## 4. Tax Credits (CIR & CII)

### A. Credit Impot Recherche (CIR) -- Research Tax Credit

The CIR is France's flagship R&D incentive and one of the most generous in Europe.

**Rate:** 30% of eligible R&D expenses (up to 100M EUR; 5% above that threshold)

**Eligible expenses:**
- Salaries of R&D personnel (engineers, researchers working on the AI model)
- Operating expenses (calculated as a percentage of salary costs -- 40% since 2025, down from 43%)
- Subcontracted R&D (to approved research organizations)
- Depreciation of R&D equipment
- Note: Patent fees and technological surveillance expenses are **no longer eligible** as of 2025

**Key benefit for startups:** PMEs, new companies, and Jeunes Entreprises Innovantes (JEI) can claim **immediate cash reimbursement** of the CIR (rather than waiting to offset against future taxes). In practice, the treasury processes this within 3-6 months after filing.

**Declaration:** Filed with annual tax return (form 2069-A-SD), within 3 months of fiscal year-end.

**CMM fit:** Excellent. Any R&D work on the AI voice model, behavioral algorithms, personalization engine, and health outcome prediction qualifies. For a 2-person team where one founder does primarily technical work, a significant portion of that salary can be CIR-eligible. At 30%, if you spend 100K EUR on eligible R&D, you get 30K EUR back from the state.

**URL:** https://entreprendre.service-public.fr/vosdroits/F23533

### B. Credit Impot Innovation (CII) -- Innovation Tax Credit

The CII is an extension of the CIR that covers innovation (not just research).

**Rate:** 20% of eligible expenses (since January 1, 2025; was 30% before). In Corsica: 35-40%.

**Cap:** 400,000 EUR of eligible expenses per year (= max credit of 80,000 EUR/year)

**Eligible expenses:** Creation of prototypes and pilot installations of new products that are superior to existing offerings in terms of technical performance, eco-design, ergonomics, or functionality.

**Eligibility:** EU-definition SMEs only (<250 employees, <50M EUR turnover or <43M EUR balance sheet)

**Duration:** Expenses incurred until December 31, 2027.

**Key rules:**
- Expenses already claimed under CIR cannot also be claimed under CII
- Production-phase expenses are not eligible
- Immediate reimbursement available for PMEs (same as CIR)

**CMM fit:** The prototype of the AI phone coaching system (before it becomes a production product) qualifies. The innovation must be "new to the market" (not just new to the company), which CMM's approach clearly is.

**URL:** https://entreprendre.service-public.fr/vosdroits/F35494

### Combined CIR + CII Strategy for CMM

| Expense | Credit | Rate |
|---------|--------|------|
| AI model R&D (NLP, voice synthesis, behavioral algorithms) | CIR | 30% |
| Health outcome prediction research | CIR | 30% |
| Prototype development of the phone coaching system | CII | 20% |
| UX/product design of novel features | CII | 20% |

**Practical tip:** Hire a CIR/CII consulting firm (they typically charge 10-15% of the credit obtained, success-fee only) to handle the filing and defend the dossier if audited. For a 2-person startup, this is worth it.

## 5. Other French Funding Sources

### A. Jeune Entreprise Innovante (JEI) Status

Not a grant, but a powerful tax status that stacks with everything else.

**Benefits:**
- Full exemption from employer social charges on R&D personnel salaries for 8 years (gradually decreasing)
- Full corporate tax exemption for the first profitable year, 50% for the second
- Local tax exemptions (CFE, CVAE) for 7 years (subject to local government approval)

**Eligibility:**
- Company less than 11 years old (extended from 8 in recent reforms)
- Fewer than 250 employees
- R&D expenses represent at least 15% of total deductible expenses
- Independent (not >25% owned by a non-qualifying entity)
- Genuinely new (not created from restructuring)

**CMM fit:** Almost certainly eligible. The R&D spend ratio should easily exceed 15% at this stage. The social charge exemption alone can save thousands per year per employee.

**URL:** https://entreprendre.service-public.fr/vosdroits/F31188

### B. French Tech Seed (OC French Tech Seed)

- **What:** Convertible bonds (obligations convertibles) to amplify seed fundraising
- **Amount:** Co-investment alongside private investors
- **Purpose:** Accelerate development of highly technology-intensive innovation projects
- **Eligibility:** Startups less than 3 years old
- **How it works:** When you raise a seed round, Bpifrance can co-invest via convertible notes, effectively increasing your round size
- **URL:** https://www.bpifrance.fr/catalogue-offres/oc-french-tech-seed
- **CMM fit:** Relevant when CMM does its seed round. The Bpifrance co-investment makes the round more attractive to private investors.

### C. Concours i-Lab

- **What:** National innovation competition run by Bpifrance and the Ministry of Research
- **Prize:** Up to 600,000 EUR in grants (non-repayable) for Grand Prix winners; typical awards 150,000-450,000 EUR
- **Timeline:** Annual competition, applications typically open January-March
- **Eligibility:** Projects creating a technology company based on innovative technology
- **URL:** https://www.bpifrance.fr/nos-appels-a-projets-concours
- **CMM fit:** Highly competitive but worth applying. The AI + health angle is strong. No need to have a company yet -- you can apply as an individual with a project.

### D. Reseau Entreprendre / Initiative France

- **What:** National networks of entrepreneurs offering honor loans (prets d'honneur)
- **Amount:** Typically 15,000-50,000 EUR at 0% interest, no collateral
- **Purpose:** Personal loan to the founder to strengthen equity before seeking other funding
- **Process:** Present to a local committee of entrepreneurs
- **CMM fit:** Good complement. The pret d'honneur strengthens the founders' equity contribution and signals commitment to banks and investors.

3. Interview with jury (if full app passes)

**Cut-off dates:** Multiple per year (typically March, June, October)

**Eligibility:** Single SME established in an EU member state

**CMM fit:** The EIC is extremely competitive (~5% success rate) and typically favors companies with significant traction. Target this for 2027-2028 after building a track record. However, the 2026 work programme includes health and AI as priority areas.

**URL:** https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-funding-opportunities/eic-accelerator_en

### B. EIC Pre-Accelerator

- **What:** Free coaching and mentoring program to prepare for the EIC Accelerator
- **Duration:** 3-6 months
- **Cost:** Free
- **CMM fit:** Apply to this first as a stepping stone to the full EIC Accelerator
- **URL:** https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-funding-opportunities/eic-pre-accelerator_en

### C. Horizon Europe -- EIC Pathfinder

- **What:** Funding for early-stage research on breakthrough technologies

## Tips for a 2-Person Startup

1. **Start with the Bourse French Tech.** It is the easiest Bpifrance grant to get, designed exactly for your stage, and receiving it unlocks access to other instruments (like the Pret d'Amorcage).

2. **Get JEI status immediately.** The social charge savings alone make it worthwhile, and it takes minimal effort.

3. **Track R&D time religiously.** From day one, have both founders log their hours on R&D activities. This is the basis for CIR/CII claims. Use a simple spreadsheet with date, person, activity description, and hours.

4. **Join an incubator.** Being accepted into an incubator (Station F, Paris&Co, Agoranov, etc.) signals legitimacy to Bpifrance and simplifies the Bourse French Tech application. Some incubators also provide direct grants.

5. **Stack non-dilutive funding.** The French system is designed to be combinable. You can simultaneously receive the Bourse French Tech + Innov'UP + CIR + CII + JEI benefits + pret d'honneur. Each one reinforces the others.

6. **Position the AI angle prominently.** France is pouring unprecedented amounts into AI (10B EUR Bpifrance plan). Frame CMM as an AI company applying to health, not a health company using AI.

7. **Build an academic partnership early.** For programs like AXA Mecenat and France 2030 health calls, having a research partner (CHU, INSERM, university) dramatically increases your chances. Start conversations now even if you apply later.

8. **Do not wait for perfection.** Bpifrance advisors expect early-stage companies to have rough plans. Contact them, present your vision, ask for guidance. They are explicitly tasked with helping startups like CMM navigate the system.
