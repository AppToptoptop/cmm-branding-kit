## 1. EXISTING WEIGHT LOSS APP NAMES

### Complete categorization of every major weight loss/health app by naming pattern:

### A. Human First Names (persona-based)

| App | Name Origin | Notes |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| **Avo** (Simple's coach) | Short for "avocado" | AI persona inside Simple app. Playful, food-themed. 55M+ chats. |
| **Gala** | Female name / gala event | AI weight loss coach persona |
| **Siri** | Norwegian female name ("beautiful woman who leads you to victory") | Voice assistant, not weight-loss-specific |
| **Alexa** | Greek origin ("defender") | Voice assistant model |
| **Cortana** | Halo video game character | Voice assistant model |
| **Rocky.AI** | Movie character Rocky Balboa | AI accountability for self-discipline |
| **Holly Health** | Female name | AI health coach, lifestyle changes |
| **Laiqa** | Female name (Arabic/South Asian) | AI + Ayurvedic health for women |

**Pattern insight:** Human names are rare in weight loss specifically, but dominant in AI voice assistants. The voice/phone call angle makes a human name especially relevant for this product.

---

### B. Action Words / Verbs

| App | Word Meaning | Notes |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| **Lose It!** | Direct action: lose weight | One of the most downloaded. Exclamation mark adds urgency. |
| **Rise** | To ascend / improve | Premium nutrition coaching |
| **Glow** | To radiate health/beauty | AI weight loss with daily phone calls (DIRECT COMPETITOR) |
| **Thrive** | To prosper / flourish | Corporate wellness platform |
| **Stride** | Confident walking movement | Fitness tracking |
| **Sweat** | Physical exertion | Kayla Itsines fitness app |
| **Persist** | To continue despite difficulty | Accountability angle |
| **Commit** | To pledge / dedicate | Habit apps |

**Pattern insight:** Action names work well when they describe the OUTCOME (Rise, Glow, Thrive) rather than the PAIN (Lose, Sweat). For a phone call product, an action word that evokes the ritual of answering/receiving is powerful.

---

### C. Descriptive / Compound Names

| App | Components | Notes |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| **MyFitnessPal** | My + Fitness + Pal | Dated "My[X]" pattern. 200M+ users but name feels 2005. |
| **FatSecret** | Fat + Secret | Calorie counter. Name is problematic by modern standards. |
| **CalorieCam** | Calorie + Camera | AI food photo recognition |
| **Cal AI** | Calorie + AI | AI food identification from photos |
| **DietBet** | Diet + Bet | Social weight loss with money stakes |
| **FoodNoms** | Food + Noms (slang for eating) | Nutrition tracker |
| **HappyScale** | Happy + Scale | Weight tracking with trend smoothing |
| **WeightWatchers** | Weight + Watchers | Rebranded to "WW" -- fleeing from descriptive name |
| **Coach Call AI** | Coach + Call + AI | Direct competitor, very literal naming |
| **Habit Coach AI** | Habit + Coach + AI | AI habit coaching |
| **SlimmerCoach** | Slimmer + Coach | AI weight loss coaching |

**Pattern insight:** Descriptive names get initial clarity but age poorly. WeightWatchers literally had to rebrand to escape theirs. The "My[X]" and "[Feature][Feature]" patterns feel generic and untrademarkable. Avoid.

---

### D. Made-Up / Invented Names

| App | Origin / Inspiration | Notes |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| **Noom** | "Moon" backwards | $1B+ ARR. Blank-canvas name filled with meaning. |
| **Yazio** | Invented, possibly Japanese-inspired | German company. Nutrition tracking. |
| **Fitbit** | Fit + Bit | Now owned by Google. Portmanteau. |
| **Cronometer** | Chrono + meter (time + measurement) | Detailed micronutrient tracking |
| **Freeletics** | Free + Athletics | AI fitness coach, 59M users |
| **Lifesum** | Life + Sum | Swedish nutrition app |
| **Habitica** | Habit + -ica (suffix) | RPG gamification of habits |
| **Strava** | Swedish: "to strive" | 100M+ users. Foreign word used as brand. |
| **Replika** | "Replica" with K | AI companion. K makes it trademarkable. |

**Pattern insight:** The highest-valued brands in this space ALL use invented or foreign-language names: Noom ($1B+), Strava (100M users), Fitbit (acquired by Google). Invented names are the easiest to trademark, the easiest to find domains for, and become the strongest brands over time.

---

### E. Emotional / Aspirational Names

| App | Emotion Evoked | Notes |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| **Calm** | Serenity, peace | $2B valuation. THE descriptive-aspirational success story. |
| **Headspace** | Mental clarity | Meditation/wellness. Compound aspirational. |
| **Glow** | Radiance, health | AI weight loss with voice calls |
| **Ember** | Warmth, inner fire | AI voice coaching for weight loss (DIRECT COMPETITOR) |
| **Fabulous** | Excellence, brilliance | Habit coaching from Duke Behavioral Lab |
| **BetterMe** | Self-improvement | 100M+ downloads |
| **BetterUp** | Upward self-improvement | $4.7B valuation, executive coaching |
| **Simple** | Ease, clarity | AI weight loss coach, home of "Avo" |
| **Welling** | Wellness, wellbeing | AI food and health coach |
| **Streaks** | Consistency, chain | Habit tracking ($4.99 paid app) |
| **Found** | Discovery, being found | Medical weight loss |
| **Calibrate** | Precision, fine-tuning | Medical weight management |

**Pattern insight:** Aspirational single-word names are extremely powerful (Calm proves it) but nearly impossible to get domains/trademarks for. The most available opportunity is in INVENTED words that SOUND aspirational.

---

### F. French-Specific / French-Market Names

| App | French Connection | Notes |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| **Peloton** | French: "the main group of riders" | $8B+ peak. French word, global brand. |
| **The Parisian Diet** | French cultural reference | Dr. Jean-Michel Cohen. France-only. |
| **Mon Coaching Minceur** | "My Slimming Coaching" | French market. Purely descriptive. |
| **Le Secret du Poids** | "The Secret of Weight" | French calorie counter. Descriptive. |
| **Foodvisor** | Pseudo-English compound | French-made AI food scanner. Uses English name. |

**Pattern insight:** French-made apps targeting France often use English names (Foodvisor) or fully French names. The best global brands from France use French words that are accessible to English speakers (Peloton). This is the sweet spot.

---

## 2. WHAT NAMING PATTERNS WORK BEST

### 2.1 Do Human Names Increase Trust/Engagement?

**YES -- especially for voice-based products.**

Evidence:
- Siri, Alexa, and Cortana all use human names because research showed it increases approachability. A Microsoft executive confirmed: "Both men and women prefer a woman, younger, for their personal assistant, by a country mile."
- Simple's AI coach "Avo" sent 55M+ messages -- the persona name creates a relationship users return to.
- Duolingo's "Duo" mascot (named character) drives 42% higher daily return rates vs. unnamed guides.
- Pi.ai deliberately invested in a "personality team" with engineers, linguists, and a creative director to craft its persona.

**Key nuance for phone calls:** When an AI CALLS you on the phone, a human name is even more important. You are literally answering a phone call. Hearing "Hi, it's Maya" creates an entirely different emotional response than "Welcome to Appello."

### 2.2 Do Action Names Drive More Downloads?

**Mixed evidence.**

- "Lose It!" is among the most downloaded weight loss apps, and its action name creates clarity.
- But "Noom" (invented, no action implied) outperforms it in revenue by 10x+.
- "Calm" (aspirational state, not action) built a $2B brand.
- Data shows consumer comprehension happens 48% faster with typical/descriptive names, and initial trust ratings show a 32% increase.
- BUT atypical names (Apple, Amazon, Noom) create stronger long-term brand moats once established.

**Conclusion:** Action names win in short-term ASO (App Store Optimization) but invented/aspirational names win in long-term brand value.

### 2.3 French Consumer Preferences for App Names

Key findings from localization research:

1. **French consumers prefer native language for app discovery** -- French keywords have higher search popularity than English equivalents in the French App Store.
2. **Brand names stay in English** -- apps in France generally do NOT translate their brand name, only their descriptions and keywords.
3. **Anglicisms are accepted** -- many English words have made their way into casual French. "Coach," "app," "fitness," "healthy" are all understood.
4. **But phonetic beauty matters** -- French speakers are sensitive to how words sound. Names should feel elegant spoken aloud in French. Nasal sounds, soft consonants, and flowing vowels are preferred.
5. **The best strategy:** A name with Romance/Latin roots that sounds natural in French AND English. Peloton is the gold standard.

### 2.4 Phonetic Psychology of Names

Research from Springer Nature and brand naming studies:

- **Soft sounds (M, L, S, N)** evoke warmth, trust, and calmness -- ideal for a coaching/wellness product.
- **Hard consonants (K, T, P)** feel strong and dynamic -- better for fitness/performance brands.
- **Vowel-heavy names** are easier to pronounce across languages: Oura, Strava, Noom.
- **Short names win** -- easier to recall, type, and search. Uber, Noom, Calm, Strava.
- Brand names are processed through the emotionally-driven right side of the brain before rational evaluation.
- 81% of consumers need to trust a brand before becoming a customer, and that starts with the name.

## 4. NAME EVALUATIONS

### Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Domain availability** | Likelihood of getting .ai, .app, or .com |
| **FR + EN pronunciation** | Can both French and English speakers say it naturally? |
| **Trademark risk** | How likely is a conflict? Invented = low risk, real words = high risk. |
| **Memorability** (1-5) | Can someone remember it after hearing it once? |
| **WL association** (1-5) | How strongly does it connect to weight loss / health transformation? |

### Tier 1: Strongest Candidates

---

#### APPELLO

- **Domain:** appello.ai likely available. appello.com possibly available (niche Latin word). appello.app likely available.
- **FR + EN pronunciation:** Excellent in both. French: "ah-PEL-oh" (natural, connects to "appel"). English: "uh-PEL-oh" (like Apollo). Spanish/Italian: native.
- **Trademark risk:** LOW. Coined usage of a Latin word. Not a common brand name.
- **Memorability:** 4/5 -- distinctive, easy to spell after hearing once.
- **WL association:** 3/5 -- not directly weight loss, but "calling" can be reframed as "your calling to change."
- **Why it works:** Follows the Peloton/Strava playbook (European-language root, globally accessible). Scales beyond weight loss. The "call" double meaning (phone call + life calling) is unique.
- **Why it might not:** Could be confused with Apollo. Slightly formal/intellectual for a warm daily coach.

---

#### REVEILLA

- **Domain:** reveilla.ai confirmed available. reveilla.com taken (offer required).
- **FR + EN pronunciation:** French: excellent ("reh-VAY-ah," connects to "reveil"). English: good but some may say "reh-VEE-lah" or "REV-uh-lah."
- **Trademark risk:** LOW. Invented spelling of a military term.
- **Memorability:** 5/5 -- distinctive, beautiful sound, emotionally resonant.
- **WL association:** 3/5 -- "wake-up call" metaphor works for accountability but not directly body/weight.
- **Why it works:** The morning wake-up call is literally what the product does. French speakers immediately connect to "reveil." The -a ending makes it feminine and approachable.
- **Why it might not:** Military connotation. English pronunciation inconsistency. Spelling confusion.

---

#### VELA

- **Domain:** vela.ai likely premium/taken. vela.app possibly available. getvela.com pattern.
- **FR + EN pronunciation:** Perfect in both. Two syllables, open vowels.
- **Trademark risk:** MEDIUM. Real Latin word, but not widely used as a brand in wellness.
- **Memorability:** 5/5 -- two syllables, easy, beautiful.
- **WL association:** 3/5 -- "setting sail" journey metaphor. Candle = inner light.
- **Why it works:** Sounds like a human name (could be the coach's name). Short like Oura, Calm, Noom. Works globally. Premium feel.
- **Why it might not:** Domain scarcity. No direct phone/call association. Needs brand-building.

---

#### ECLAT

- **Domain:** eclat.ai possibly available. eclat.com premium/taken (cosmetics brands).
- **FR + EN pronunciation:** French: perfect, native word. English: "ay-KLAH" or "eh-KLAT" -- may be mispronounced.

- **Memorability:** 5/5 -- short, punchy, distinctive.
- **WL association:** 4/5 -- radiance, glow, health. "Retrouver son eclat" = rediscover your radiance.
- **Why it works:** Aspirational and French. The word itself feels like transformation. Premium.
- **Why it might not:** Cosmetics brand conflicts. English pronunciation varies. Accent mark needed (eclat vs. eclat).

---

#### AURORE (dual-purpose: app name AND coach name)

- **Domain:** aurore.ai likely available. aurore.com likely taken (it is a real French name).
- **FR + EN pronunciation:** French: perfect, it IS a French name. English: "oh-ROR" -- slightly unfamiliar but pronounceable.
- **Trademark risk:** MEDIUM. Real name, but uncommon as a tech brand.
- **Memorability:** 5/5 -- beautiful, distinctive, immediately evokes dawn/morning.
- **WL association:** 3/5 -- dawn = new beginning, morning ritual. Not directly body/weight.

- **Why it might not:** English speakers may struggle. Very French-specific.

---

#### SOLA

- **Domain:** sola.ai likely premium. sola.app possibly available. trysola.com pattern.
- **FR + EN pronunciation:** Perfect in both. Two syllables, universal.
- **Trademark risk:** MEDIUM. Some existing uses in tech/solar.
- **Memorability:** 5/5 -- two syllables, warm, simple.
- **WL association:** 3/5 -- "sun/light" health metaphor. "You're not alone (not sola)."
- **Why it works:** Sounds human. Could be a coach name. Solar/light associations are warm and positive. Works in FR, EN, ES, IT.
- **Why it might not:** In Spanish/Italian, "sola" means "alone" (feminine) -- could be negative. Domain scarcity.

---

### Tier 2: Strong Candidates

---

#### CONSTANCE

- **Domain:** constance.ai possibly available. constance.com definitely taken.
- **FR + EN pronunciation:** Perfect in both -- it is literally the same word.
- **Trademark risk:** HIGH. Real name, real word, likely conflicts.
- **Memorability:** 5/5
- **WL association:** 3/5 -- consistency is the core accountability message.
- **Why it works:** Dual purpose -- it IS a French female name AND means consistency/steadfastness. "Constance is calling." Perfect semantic fit.

- **Memorability:** 4/5 -- distinctive for English speakers, common for French.
- **WL association:** 5/5 -- THIS IS the transformation word. "Becoming" is the entire journey.

- **Why it might not:** Very French. English speakers will not feel it. Three syllables.

---

#### LUMEA

- **Domain:** lumea.ai likely available. lumea.com possibly available (less common word).

- **Memorability:** 4/5 -- pleasant, three syllables.
- **WL association:** 3/5 -- light, enlightenment, seeing clearly.
- **Why it works:** Invented and trademarkable. Light/luminous associations. Works as both a brand name and a persona name. Global pronunciation.

---

#### ALTERA

- **Domain:** altera.ai taken (Intel/Altera FPGA company). altera.app possibly available.
- **FR + EN pronunciation:** Excellent in both.

- **Memorability:** 4/5
- **WL association:** 4/5 -- "to alter, to change" is directly transformational.
- **Why it works:** Latin root understood globally. "Alter" = change. Feminine -a ending.
- **Why it might not:** Intel's Altera is a major conflict. Cannot use altera.ai.

---

#### SONORA

- **Domain:** sonora.ai possibly available. sonora.com taken (geography).
- **FR + EN pronunciation:** Perfect in both.
- **Trademark risk:** MEDIUM. Real place name (Sonora, Mexico/Arizona). Musical term.

- **Why it works:** From "sonner" (to ring). Musical, warm. Sounds like a person's name. The phone rings with Sonora.
- **Why it might not:** Geography associations. No weight loss connection. "Sonora desert" may dominate SEO.

### Tier 3: Interesting But Risky

| Name | Main Strength | Main Risk | Score |
|------|-------------|----------|:---:|
| **Svelta** | Most directly weight-loss-associated | May feel body-shaming ("svelte" pressure) | 3.5/5 |
| **Eclore** | Beautiful French "to bloom" metaphor | Too French for global use | 3/5 |

## 5. APP NAME VS COACH NAME: THE KEY QUESTION

### How Top AI Products Handle This

#### Model 1: APP NAME = PERSONA NAME (unified)

| Product | Name | How It Works |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Siri** | App is Siri, persona is Siri | One name for everything. You "talk to Siri." |
| **Alexa** | Device is Echo, persona is Alexa | Wake word is the persona name. "Alexa, play music." |
| **Pi.ai** | App is Pi, persona is Pi | "Pi" stands for "Personal Intelligence." You talk to Pi. |

**Pros:** Simple, memorable, one thing to market. Strong identity.
**Cons:** If the persona needs to change or you want multiple personas, you are locked in.

#### Model 2: APP NAME + SEPARATE PERSONA NAME (dual)

| Product | App Name | Persona Name | How It Works |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Simple** | Simple | Avo | The app is "Simple." Inside lives "Avo," the AI coach. Users bond with Avo. |
| **Replika** | Replika | User-chosen name | The app is "Replika." Each user names their own AI companion. |
| **Character.ai** | Character.ai | Thousands of characters | The platform is "Character.ai." Users choose/create personas. |
| **Duolingo** | Duolingo | Duo (the owl) | The app is "Duolingo." The mascot/coach is "Duo." |

**Pros:** Flexibility. App brand can scale to multiple coaches/personas. Users can have emotional relationship with persona while app brand stays professional.
**Cons:** Two names to establish. Users may bond with persona but not app (or vice versa). Complexity.

#### Model 3: APP NAME IS DESCRIPTIVE, PERSONA IS THE STAR

| Product | App Name | Persona Name | How It Works |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Glow** | Glow | (unnamed coach voice) | App = aspirational brand. Coach = anonymous but warm. |
| **Ember** | Ember | (unnamed coach voice) | App = aspirational brand. Daily voice calls from "your Ember coach." |

**Pros:** The brand IS the emotion. No persona name to establish.
**Cons:** Harder to build parasocial relationship. Less "human" feeling.

### Recommendation for This Product

**USE BOTH: App name + Coach persona name. Here is why:**

1. **The phone call demands a name.** When the AI calls you at 7am, it needs to say "Hi, it's [NAME]." This is not optional. You cannot answer a phone call from a nameless entity. "Hi, it's your Appello coach" is worse than "Hi, it's Aurore from Appello."

2. **The Simple/Avo model is proven at scale.** Simple's AI coach "Avo" has had 55M+ conversations. Users form a relationship with the PERSONA (Avo) while the APP (Simple) maintains brand flexibility.

3. **Dual naming enables expansion.** If the product expands beyond weight loss (executive coaching, mental health, language learning), the app name stays constant while you introduce new coach personas for new verticals.

4. **French market loves named personas.** French culture values personal relationships. A coach with a name feels like a personal service, not an algorithm.

5. **The Duolingo effect.** Duo the owl drives viral marketing that Duolingo-the-app could never achieve alone. A named coach persona becomes a character that can appear in marketing, social media, and user-generated content.

### Recommended Pairings

| App Name | Coach Name | Tagline | Why This Works |
|----------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **Appello** | **Aurore** | "Aurore is calling." | App = classical, global, scalable. Coach = French, warm, dawn. "Aurore from Appello" sounds like a premium service. |
| **Appello** | **Vela** | "Vela, your daily call." | App = call/appeal. Coach = sail/light. More international than Aurore. |
| **Appello** | **Elina** | "Elina from Appello." | App = classical. Coach = light, warmth. Modern, global. |
| **Reveilla** | **Maya** | "Maya from Reveilla." | App = wake-up call. Coach = universal warm name. |
| **Reveilla** | **Solene** | "Solene, votre coach." | App = wake-up. Coach = distinguished French name. Very France-first. |
| **Eclat** | **Mila** | "Mila from Eclat." | App = radiance. Coach = warmth. Both short, punchy. |
| **Lumea** | **Cleo** | "Cleo from Lumea." | App = light/world. Coach = glory. Premium, distinctive. |

### The Strongest Pairing

**Appello + Aurore**

- **Appello** is the strongest app name from all research: Latin roots, global pronunciation, "to call" double meaning, scales beyond weight loss, easy to trademark.
- **Aurore** is the strongest coach name: it IS a French female name (warm, real, relatable), it means "dawn" (the morning call), it creates the tagline naturally ("Aurore is calling"), and it has aspirational depth ("a new dawn").
- Together: "Hi, it's Aurore from Appello" -- this sounds like a premium personal coaching service, not an app, not a robot.
- The user bonds with Aurore (the daily voice). The brand builds on Appello (the platform).
- When expanding to other verticals: you can introduce "Marcus from Appello" (executive coaching) or "Zen from Appello" (meditation) without changing the platform brand.

## SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Naming Pattern Winners
- **Invented/foreign-language names** build the strongest brands (Noom, Strava, Oura)
- **Short names** (1-3 syllables) outperform in recall and global accessibility
- **Latin/Romance roots** are the sweet spot for a France-first, globally-expanding product
- **Avoid:** descriptive compound names (MyFitnessPal pattern), the "Better[X]" pattern, and English-only puns

### 2. The Phone Call Changes Everything
- Voice products need human names more than screen products
- Glow and Ember are DIRECT COMPETITORS already doing daily AI calls for weight loss
- The differentiator must be the PERSONALITY and RELATIONSHIP, not just the call mechanism

### 3. France-First Strategy
- French consumers keep English brand names but prefer French app descriptions
- Phonetic beauty matters more in French than English
- A French-origin name with global accessibility (like Peloton) is the optimal strategy

### 4. App + Coach Dual Naming Is The Way
- Proven at scale (Simple/Avo, Duolingo/Duo)
- Essential for a phone-call product (someone needs to say hello)
- Enables future expansion without brand confusion

### 5. Top Recommendation
- **App:** Appello (appello.ai)
- **Coach:** Aurore
- **Tagline:** "Aurore is calling." / "L'appel du changement."

## APPENDIX: DIRECT COMPETITOR NAMING

These apps are the closest competitors -- they also use AI voice/phone calls for weight loss:

| Competitor | Name Type | Domain | Naming Analysis |
|-----------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Glow** | Aspirational single word | glowhealthai.com | Strong emotional name. "Glow" = radiance, health. But very generic, hard to own. |
| **Ember** | Aspirational single word | tryember.ai | Inner fire, warmth. Slightly better than Glow for accountability (embers must be tended). |
| **Simple** | Descriptive single word | simple.life | Clarity, ease. Houses "Avo" persona. Broad, not weight-loss-specific. |
| **Welling** | Aspirational compound | welling.ai | "Wellness" + feeling. Warm but forgettable. |
| **Coach Call AI** | Hyper-descriptive | coachcall.ai | Zero brand equity. Functional name only. Impossible to differentiate. |

**Takeaway:** None of these competitors have a truly distinctive, ownable, globally-scalable name. The market is wide open for a Peloton-caliber name in the AI weight loss coaching space.
